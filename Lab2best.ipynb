    "# Lab 2 - Data Types, String/File Processing, Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second lab we will be looking at some of the more important skills needed to do text analysis. In order to start doing text analysis you first need to have text to analyze. This text will be stored in various data types. In the last lab you already saw two data types: int (for storing whole numbers) and strings. In this lab we will look at other important data types needed to do text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will look at string and file processing. We will learn how to read data to and from text files, how to store the data in data types such as strings and lists. And then we will do string processing on this data that is now stored in a string or list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly one of the most important things is file encodings. Computers store data as 0s and 1s so in order to read a text file we need to convert those 0s and 1s to letters. This is done using an encoding scheme. The problem is that there are lots of encoding schemes and different ones are used all the time. Some of the more common ones are utf-8 and utf-16 as well as latin1. So whenever you open a text file you need to make sure you are using the correct encoding scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types are one of the basic building blocks of your code. As mentioned earlier, data types are used to store information which we can then work with in various ways. In python the data type is automatically determined when you first assign a value to a variable. So when we assigned the number '18' to the variable 'age' in the last lab, the variable 'age' was turned into an integer data type.\n",

    "#### Storing Numbers\n",

It's part of a great [introduction to NLP using python](https://www.nltk.org/book/). \n",

      "\n",
      "You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\n",
      "Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.  That book was made\n",
      "by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things\n",
      "which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I\n",
      "never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\n",
      "Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she\n",
      "is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\n",
      "is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six\n",
      "thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when\n",
      "it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\n",
      "at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\n",
      "round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\n",
      "it no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\n",
      "sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing\n",
      "commenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\n",
      "to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\n",
      "you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\n",
      "over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\n",
      "them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a\n",
      "barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\n",
      "juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\n",
      "then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\n",
      "dead people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she\n",
      "wouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\n",
      "try to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she was\n",
      "a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\n",
      "being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\n",
      "thing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that\n",
      "was all right, because she done it herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\n",
      "the widow made her ease up.  I couldn't stood it much longer.  Then for\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,\n",
      "“Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don't scrunch up\n",
      "like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would\n",
      "say, “Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\n",
      "behave?”  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\n",
      "I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm.  All I wanted\n",
      "was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\n",
      " She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\n",
      "the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\n",
      " Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\n",
      "made up my mind I wouldn't try for it.  But I never said so, because it\n",
      "would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\n",
      "place.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\n",
      "day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn't think\n",
      "much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\n",
      "would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad\n",
      "about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\n",
      " By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\n",
      "everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\n",
      "and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.  I felt\n",
      "so lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\n",
      "to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\n",
      "it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\n",
      "that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\n",
      "something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\n",
      "can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\n",

      "was all shriveled up.  I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\n",
      "an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\n",
      "and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\n",

      "We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\n",
      "the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\n",
      "heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\n",
      "a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson's big nigger,\n",
      "named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\n",
      "clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched\n",
      "his neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who dah?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\n",
      "between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was\n",
      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\n",
      "together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\n",
      "dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\n",
      "right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\n",
      " Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with\n",
      "the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\n",
      "sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\n",
      "you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\n",

      "\n",
      "So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up\n",
      "against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\n",
      "one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into\n",
      "my eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.\n",
      "Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn't know how I was going to set\n",
      "still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\n",
      "it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different\n",
      "places now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,\n",
      "but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun\n",
      "to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\n",
      "comfortable again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\n",
      "went creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom\n",
      "whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said\n",
      "no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I\n",
      "warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip\n",
      "in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jim\n",
      "might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\n",
      "and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\n",
      "Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\n",
      "Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\n",
      "something on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\n",
      "so still and lonesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\n",
      "and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\n",
      "the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it\n",
      "on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.\n",
      "Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\n",
      "and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\n",
      "and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told\n",
      "it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\n",
      "time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\n",
      "rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\n",
      "was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\n",
      "got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come\n",
      "miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\n",
      "nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\n",
      "open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is\n",
      "always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\n",
      "whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\n",
      "Jim would happen in and say, “Hm!  What you know 'bout witches?” and\n",
      "that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept\n",
      "that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\n",
      "charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\n",
      "cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\n",
      "saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\n",
      " Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\n",
      "had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch\n",
      "it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for\n",
      "a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\n",
      "and been rode by witches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\n",
      "into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\n",
      "there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\n",
      "so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\n",
      "awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\n",
      "Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\n",
      " So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\n",
      "to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\n",
      "part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\n",
      "hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\n",
      "under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  We\n",
      "went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\n",
      "sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\n",
      "in blood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\n",
      "wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the\n",
      "band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\n",
      "any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\n",
      "his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\n",
      "had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\n",
      "of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\n",
      "mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\n",
      "killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\n",
      "must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\n",
      "ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\n",
      "blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\n",
      "and be forgot forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\n",
      "it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\n",
      "pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\n",
      "the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\n",
      "it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, hain't he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days.  He\n",
      "used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen\n",
      "in these parts for a year or more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\n",
      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of\n",
      "anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready\n",
      "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\n",
      "Watson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, she'll do.  That's all right.  Huck can come in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\n",
      "and I made my mark on the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what's the line of business of this Gang?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,”\n",
      " says Tom Sawyer.  “We ain't burglars.  That ain't no sort of style.  We\n",
      "are highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\n",
      "on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Must we always kill the people?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, certainly.  It's best.  Some authorities think different, but\n",
      "mostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, I don't know.  But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed,\n",

      "they get here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because it ain't in the books so--that's why.  Now, Ben Rogers, do you\n",

      "reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct\n",
      "thing to do?  Do you reckon _you_ can learn 'em anything?  Not by a good\n",

      "the women?  No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.  You\n",
      "fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them;\n",
      "and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any\n",
      "more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.\n",
      "Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows\n",

      "and prayed, but nothing come of it.  She told me to pray every day, and\n",
      "whatever I asked for I would get it.  But it warn't so.  I tried it.\n",
      "Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks.  It warn't any good to me without\n",

      "No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it.  I went and told the\n",
      "widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for\n",
      "it was “spiritual gifts.”  This was too many for me, but she told me\n",
      "what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for\n",
      "other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about\n",
      "myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.  I went out in the\n",
      "woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no\n",
      "advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned\n",
      "I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go.  Sometimes the\n",
      "widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make\n",
      "a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold\n",
      "and knock it all down again.  I judged I could see that there was two\n",

      "been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all.  They said\n",
      "he was floating on his back in the water.  They took him and buried him\n",
      "on the bank.  But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to think\n",
      "of something.  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on\n",
      "his back, but on his face.  So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but\n",

      "every time.  (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got\n",
      "from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball\n",
      "would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference.  Jim smelt\n",
      "it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball\n",
      "would think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato\n",
      "and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next\n",

      "great times now if I was over at the town.  The June rise used to be\n",
      "always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes\n",
      "cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs\n",

      "high like a duck.  I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,\n",
      "clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.  I just expected\n",
      "there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that\n",
      "to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd\n",
      "raise up and laugh at him.  But it warn't so this time.  It was a\n",
      "drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks\n",
      "I, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she's worth ten dollars.\n",

      "willows, I struck another idea:  I judged I'd hide her good, and then,\n",
      "'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river\n",
      "about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a\n",
      "rough time tramping on foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man\n",
      "coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around\n",
      "a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just\n",

      "When he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line.  He abused\n",
      "me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and\n",
      "that was what made me so long.  I knowed he would see I was wet, and\n",
      "then he would be asking questions.  We got five catfish off the lines\n",
      "and went home.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about\n",
      "wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap\n",
      "and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing\n",
      "than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you\n",
      "see, all kinds of things might happen.  Well, I didn't see no way for a\n",

      "water, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you\n",
      "hear? That man warn't here for no good.  I'd a shot him.  Next time you\n",
      "roust me out, you hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been\n",
      "saying give me the very idea I wanted.  I says to myself, I can fix it\n",
      "now so nobody won't think of following me.\n",

      "About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  The\n",
      "river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the\n",
      "rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.\n",
      " We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.\n",
      "Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch\n",
      "more stuff; but that warn't pap's style.  Nine logs was enough for one\n",
      "time; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and\n",
      "took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.\n",
      " I judged he wouldn't come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he\n",
      "had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that\n",
      "log again.  Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the\n",
      "hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and\n",
      "shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\n",
      "with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and\n",
      "sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\n",
      "bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\n",
      "blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and\n",
      "matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned\n",
      "out the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\n",
      "at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched\n",
      "out the gun, and now I was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\n",
      "out so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\n",
      "by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the\n",
      "sawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\n",
      "rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up\n",
      "at that place and didn't quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five\n",
      "foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice\n",
      "it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely\n",
      "anybody would go fooling around there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.  I\n",
      "followed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the\n",
      "river.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\n",
      "and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\n",
      "went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\n",
      "farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it\n",
      "considerable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\n",
      "to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\n",
      "on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\n",
      "and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\n",
      "in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\n",
      "the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\n",
      "down it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been\n",
      "dragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\n",
      "would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\n",
      "touches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\n",
      "that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\n",
      "stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I\n",
      "took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\n",
      "drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\n",
      "the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag\n",
      "of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\n",
      " I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\n",
      "bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the\n",
      "place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then\n",
      "I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\n",
      "the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\n",
      "and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There\n",
      "was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\n",
      "miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The meal\n",
      "sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped\n",
      "pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\n",
      "accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\n",
      "wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\n",
      "willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I\n",
      "made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\n",
      "down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,\n",
      "they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\n",
      "drag the river for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the lake\n",
      "and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\n",
      "that killed me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river for\n",
      "anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\n",
      "bother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\n",
      "Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\n",
      "and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,\n",
      "and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When\n",
      "I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked\n",
      "around, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and\n",
      "miles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\n",
      "that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\n",
      "shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\n",
      "You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\n",
      "when I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I\n",
      "made it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\n",
      "oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.  I peeped out through\n",
      "the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.\n",
      " I couldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was\n",
      "abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybe\n",
      "it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with the\n",
      "current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\n",
      "and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\n",
      " Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his\n",
      "oars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream\n",
      "soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,\n",
      "and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\n",
      "the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\n",
      "people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and\n",
      "then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\n",
      "\n",
      " I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\n",
      "away into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when\n",
      "you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\n",
      " And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people\n",
      "talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\n",
      "of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\n",
      "nights now.  T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\n",
      "reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\n",
      "laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\n",
      "laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\n",
      "let him alone.  The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his\n",
      "old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\n",
      "nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\n",
      "was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than\n",
      "about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,\n",
      "and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\n",
      "and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson's\n",
      "Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\n",
      "standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\n",
      "a steamboat without any lights.  There warn't any signs of the bar at\n",
      "the head--it was all under water now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping\n",
      "rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\n",
      "landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into\n",
      "a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\n",
      "branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\n",
      "from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\n",
      "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\n",
      "three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A\n",
      "monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\n",
      "with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,\n",
      "and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern\n",
      "oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!”  I heard that just as plain\n",
      "as if the man was by my side.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\n",
      "o'clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\n",
      "things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I\n",
      "could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\n",
      "all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places\n",
      "on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\n",
      "freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\n",
      "breeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\n",
      "very friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\n",
      "breakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\n",
      "sound of “boom!” away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\n",
      "and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and\n",
      "looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\n",
      "on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the\n",
      "ferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the\n",
      "matter now.  “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\n",
      "side.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\n",
      "carcass come to the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\n",
      "because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the\n",
      "cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,\n",
      "and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\n",
      "enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\n",
      "eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\n",
      "loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\n",
      "drownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and\n",
      "if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.  I\n",
      "changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\n",
      "have, and I warn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I\n",
      "most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\n",
      "further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\n",
      "shore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,\n",
      "and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\n",
      "of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was “baker's bread”--what the\n",
      "quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\n",
      "the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And\n",
      "then something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\n",
      "or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\n",
      "and done it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that\n",
      "thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the\n",
      "parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for\n",
      "only just the right kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The\n",
      "ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\n",
      "to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\n",
      "close, where the bread did.  When she'd got pretty well along down\n",
      "towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\n",
      "and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where\n",
      "the log forked I could peep through.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\n",
      "a run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.\n",
      " Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\n",
      "Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\n",

      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\n",
      "washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.  I\n",
      "hope so, anyway.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\n",
      "in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see\n",
      "them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\n",
      "it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\n",
      "I judged I was gone.  If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd\n",
      "a got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\n",
      "goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\n",
      "of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and\n",
      "further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.\n",
      " The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and\n",
      "was giving it up.  But they didn't yet a while.  They turned around\n",
      "the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\n",
      "under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over\n",
      "to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\n",
      "island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\n",
      "went home to the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after\n",
      "me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\n",
      "woods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\n",
      "under so the rain couldn't get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled\n",
      "him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\n",
      "supper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\n",
      "satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\n",
      "on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\n",
      "stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\n",

      "\n",
      "And so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.\n",
      "But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was\n",
      "boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\n",
      "all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty\n",
      "strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\n",
      "razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They\n",
      "would all come handy by and by, I judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\n",
      "far from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\n",
      "nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\n",
      "home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\n",
      "and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\n",
      "it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\n",
      "bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look\n",
      "further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\n",
      "fast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\n",
      "thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear\n",
      "nothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\n",
      "and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\n",
      "on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\n",
      "breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\n",
      "in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around.  So I\n",
      "got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\n",
      "and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\n",
      "old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,\n",
      "I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\n",
      "thousand things.  Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\n",
      "got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\n",
      "time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good\n",
      "and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\n",
      "Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and\n",
      "cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\n",
      "all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\n",
      "to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices.  I got\n",
      "everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\n",
      "through the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn't got far when I\n",
      "hear a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\n",
      "beat out.  Let's look around.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the\n",
      "old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't sleep much.  I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.  And every time\n",
      "I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn't\n",
      "do me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\n",
      "a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\n",
      "find it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\n",
      "then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was\n",
      "shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\n",
      " I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\n",
      "asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A\n",
      "little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying\n",
      "the night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung\n",
      "her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge\n",
      "of the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the\n",
      "leaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket\n",
      "the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\n",
      "and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards\n",
      "where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two\n",
      "to listen.  But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the\n",
      "place.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away\n",
      "through the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was\n",
      "close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It\n",
      "most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his\n",
      "head was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in\n",
      "about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting\n",
      "gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\n",
      "off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!  I bet I was glad to see\n",
      "him.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,\n",
      "and puts his hands together and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doan' hurt me--don't!  I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.  I alwuz\n",
      "liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em.  You go en git in de\n",

      "glad to see Jim.  I warn't lonesome now.  I told him I warn't afraid of\n",
      "_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set\n",
      "there and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's good daylight.  Le's get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich\n",

      "“And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sah--nuffn else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?”\n",

      "a gun.  Dat's good.  Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in\n",
      "a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and\n",
      "coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the\n",
      "nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done\n",
      "with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him\n",
      "with his knife, and fried him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\n",
      "Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then\n",

      "I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island\n",
      "that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,\n",
      "because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile\n",
      "wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\n",
      "high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\n",
      "the bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\n",
      "and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the\n",
      "side towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\n",
      "bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in\n",
      "there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\n",
      "didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\n",
      "in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\n",
      "and they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them\n",
      "little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\n",
      "get wet?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\n",
      "and lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by\n",
      "to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\n",
      "side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\n",
      "good place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\n",
      "We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty\n",
      "soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was\n",
      "right about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,\n",
      "too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular\n",
      "summer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black\n",
      "outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that\n",
      "the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would\n",
      "come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\n",
      "pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would\n",
      "follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\n",
      "was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and\n",
      "blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little\n",

      "hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\n",
      "in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,\n",
      "and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the\n",

      "it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same\n",

      "so thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old\n",
      "broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\n",
      "when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\n",
      "account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your\n",
      "hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would\n",
      "slide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\n",

      "\n",
      "One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.\n",
      "It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and\n",
      "the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We\n",
      "could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;\n",
      "we didn't show ourselves in daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\n",
      "daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was\n",
      "a two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got\n",
      "aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,\n",
      "so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then\n",
      "we looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and\n",
      "two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there\n",
      "was clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the\n",

      "at his face--it's too gashly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\n",
      "he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.  There was heaps of old\n",
      "greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,\n",
      "and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\n",
      "was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\n",
      " There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\n",
      "women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,\n",

      "was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a\n",

      "\n",
      "We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\n",
      "a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\n",
      "candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\n",
      "old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and\n",
      "beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet\n",

      "and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label\n",
      "on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,\n",

      "was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though\n",

      "He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  That all\n",
      "comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave\n",
      "a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  Jim told\n",
      "me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the\n",
      "body and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said it\n",
      "would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around\n",
      "his wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet\n",

      "that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't\n",
      "got to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his\n",
      "left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin\n",
      "in his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've\n",
      "always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is\n",
      "one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank\n",
      "Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he\n",
      "got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so\n",
      "that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\n",
      "again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\n",
      "hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was\n",
      "as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\n",
      "hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us\n",
      "into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around\n",
      "till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\n",
      "ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,\n",
      "and there was a spool in it.  Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to\n",
      "coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever\n",
      "catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn't ever seen\n",
      "a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.\n",
      " They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house\n",

      "\n",
      "Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a\n",
      "stirring up some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and\n",
      "find out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I\n",
      "must go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,\n",
      "couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\n",
      " That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico\n",
      "gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim\n",
      "hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the\n",
      "sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\n",
      "and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said\n",
      "nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around\n",
      "all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\n",
      "well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said\n",
      "I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.  I took\n",

      "I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and\n",
      "the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.  I\n",
      "tied up and started along the bank.  There was a light burning in a\n",
      "little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered\n",
      "who had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at the\n",
      "window.  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by\n",
      "a candle that was on a pine table.  I didn't know her face; she was a\n",

      "been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to\n",

      "about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner\n",
      "every little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at\n",
      "them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace.  She showed\n",
      "me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot\n",
      "with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't\n",
      "know whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,\n",
      "and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said\n",
      "“Ouch!” it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to try for the next one.\n",
      " I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course\n",
      "I didn't let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his\n",
      "nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a\n",
      "tolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\n",
      "would hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched\n",
      "it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\n",
      "her with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\n",
      "went on talking about her and her husband's matters.  But she broke off\n",
      "to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap,\n",
      "handy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped\n",
      "my legs together on it and she went on talking.  But only about a\n",
      "minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,\n",
      "and very pleasant, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, now, what's your real name?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“What's your real name?  Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do.  But\n",
      "I says:\n",

      "“No, you won't.  Set down and stay where you are.  I ain't going to hurt\n",
      "you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther.  You just tell me your\n",
      "secret, and trust me.  I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll help\n",
      "you. So'll my old man if you want him to.  You see, you're a runaway\n",
      "'prentice, that's all.  It ain't anything.  There ain't no harm in it.\n",
      "You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.  Bless you,\n",

      "would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't\n",
      "go back on her promise.  Then I told her my father and mother was dead,\n",
      "and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty\n",
      "mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it\n",
      "no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\n",
      "chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and\n",
      "I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,\n",
      "and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from\n",
      "home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my\n",
      "uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck\n",
      "out for this town of Goshen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Goshen, child?  This ain't Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen's\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn\n",
      "into the woods for my regular sleep.  He told me when the roads forked I\n",
      "must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now.  I got\n",
      "to be moving along.  I'll fetch Goshen before daylight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on a minute.  I'll put you up a snack to eat.  You might want it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she put me up a snack, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first?  Answer\n",
      "up prompt now--don't stop to study over it.  Which end gets up first?”\n",

      "“North side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with\n",
      "their heads pointed the same direction?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The whole fifteen, mum.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country.  I thought maybe you\n",

      "“Well, try to remember it, George.  Don't forget and tell me it's\n",
      "Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George\n",
      "Elexander when I catch you.  And don't go about women in that old\n",
      "calico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.\n",
      " Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the\n",
      "thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and\n",
      "poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a\n",
      "man always does t'other way.  And when you throw at a rat or anything,\n",
      "hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as\n",
      "awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw\n",
      "stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to\n",
      "turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out\n",
      "to one side, like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch\n",
      "anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them\n",
      "together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.  Why, I\n",
      "spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived\n",
      "the other things just to make certain.  Now trot along to your uncle,\n",
      "Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble\n",
      "you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can\n",
      "to get you out of it.  Keep the river road all the way, and next time\n",
      "you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one,\n",
      "and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks\n",
      "and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.  I\n",
      "jumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went up-stream far enough to\n",
      "make the head of the island, and then started across.  I took off the\n",
      "sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then.  When I was about the\n",
      "middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the\n",
      "sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven.  When I struck the\n",
      "head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but\n",
      "I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started\n",
      "a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half\n",
      "below, as hard as I could go.  I landed, and slopped through the timber\n",
      "and up the ridge and into the cavern.  There Jim laid, sound asleep on\n",
      "the ground.  I roused him out and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Git up and hump yourself, Jim!  There ain't a minute to lose.  They're\n",
      "after us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he\n",
      "worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.  By\n",
      "that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was\n",
      "ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  We\n",
      "put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a\n",
      "candle outside after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;\n",
      "but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows\n",
      "ain't good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down\n",
      "in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a\n",
      "word.\n",

      "CHAPTER XII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at\n",
      "last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to come\n",
      "along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\n",
      "shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to\n",
      "put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We\n",
      "was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  It warn't\n",
      "good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\n",
      "built, and watched it all night for Jim to come.  Anyways, they stayed\n",
      "away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no\n",
      "fault of mine.  I played it as low down on them as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\n",
      "big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\n",
      "the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\n",
      "had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has\n",
      "cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\n",
      "side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\n",
      "warn't afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,\n",
      "and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\n",
      "up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all\n",
      "about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\n",
      "a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set\n",
      "down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then, I\n",
      "said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he\n",
      "bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\n",
      "believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\n",
      "time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\n",
      "below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\n",
      " So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long\n",
      "as they didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\n",
      "cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\n",
      "so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\n",
      "wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\n",
      "dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\n",
      "the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\n",
      "reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\n",
      "layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\n",
      "to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\n",
      "or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra\n",
      "steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\n",
      "or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\n",
      "on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\n",
      "coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have\n",
      "to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\n",
      "a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\n",
      "still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the\n",
      "channel, but hunted easy water.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\n",
      "that was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,\n",
      "and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of\n",
      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\n",
      "up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it\n",
      "warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We\n",
      "had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to\n",
      "us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\n",
      "nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The\n",
      "fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\n",
      "In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\n",
      "people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\n",
      "spread of lights at two o'clock that still night.  There warn't a sound\n",
      "there; everybody was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little\n",
      "village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other\n",
      "stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting\n",
      "comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when\n",
      "you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy\n",
      "find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never see\n",
      "pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to\n",
      "say, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\n",
      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\n",
      "that kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you\n",
      "was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't\n",
      "anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\n",
      " Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\n",
      "right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\n",
      "from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned\n",
      "it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all\n",
      "one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\n",
      "whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\n",
      "or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\n",
      "concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just\n",
      "right before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way\n",
      "it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons\n",
      "wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\n",
      "or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we\n",
      "lived pretty high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\n",
      "a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\n",
      "sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\n",
      "When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\n",
      "and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, “Hel-_lo_, Jim,\n",
      "looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\n",
      " We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very\n",
      "distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\n",
      "water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a\n",
      "chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,\n",
      "when the flashes come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,\n",
      "I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck\n",
      "laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I\n",
      "wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what\n",
      "there was there.  So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Le's land on her, Jim.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack.  We's doin' blame' well,\n",
      "en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not\n",
      "dey's a watchman on dat wrack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain't nothing to watch but\n",
      "the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk\n",
      "his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\n",
      "it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?”  Jim\n",
      "couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  “And besides,” I says,\n",
      "“we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.\n",
      " Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat\n",
      "captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don't\n",
      "care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a\n",
      "candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\n",
      " Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he\n",
      "wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd\n",
      "land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw style\n",
      "into it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd think it\n",
      "was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer\n",
      "_was_ here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't talk any more\n",
      "than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us\n",
      "the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\n",
      "made fast there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to\n",
      "labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our\n",
      "feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\n",
      "dark we couldn't see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward\n",
      "end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in\n",
      "front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down\n",
      "through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we\n",
      "seem to hear low voices in yonder!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\n",
      "along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just\n",
      "then I heard a voice wail out and say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another voice said, pretty loud:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a lie, Jim Turner.  You've acted this way before.  You always want\n",
      "more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because\n",
      "you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell.  But this time you've said\n",
      "it jest one time too many.  You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in\n",
      "this country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with\n",
      "curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,\n",
      "and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here.  So I\n",
      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\n",
      "in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\n",
      "cross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the\n",
      "floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\n",
      "of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\n",
      " This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd _like_ to!  And I orter, too--a mean skunk!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don't, Bill;\n",
      "I hain't ever goin' to tell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and\n",
      "say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Deed you _ain't!_  You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet\n",
      "you.” And once he said:  “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the\n",
      "best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both.  And what _for_?  Jist\n",
      "for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for.  But\n",
      "I lay you ain't a-goin' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.  Put\n",
      "_up_ that pistol, Bill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't want to, Jake Packard.  I'm for killin' him--and didn't he kill\n",
      "old Hatfield jist the same way--and don't he deserve it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don't _want_ him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I'll never forgit you\n",
      "long's I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail\n",
      "and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\n",
      "to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat\n",
      "slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting\n",
      "run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.\n",
      " The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my\n",
      "stateroom, he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here--come in here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up\n",
      "in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,\n",
      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn't see\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.\n",
      " I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference\n",
      "anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I\n",
      "didn't breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn't_\n",
      "breathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted\n",
      "to kill Turner.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's said he'll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both our shares\n",
      "to him _now_ it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way\n",
      "we've served him.  Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; now\n",
      "you hear _me_.  I'm for putting him out of his troubles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So'm I,” says Packard, very quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't.  Well, then, that's all\n",
      "right.  Le's go and do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit.  You listen to me.\n",
      "Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's _got_ to be\n",
      "done. But what I say is this:  it ain't good sense to go court'n around\n",
      "after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's\n",
      "jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks.  Ain't\n",
      "that so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You bet it is.  But how you goin' to manage it this time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my idea is this:  we'll rustle around and gather up whatever\n",
      "pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide\n",
      "the truck. Then we'll wait.  Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n two\n",
      "hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?\n",
      "He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own\n",
      "self.  I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.\n",
      " I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it\n",
      "ain't good sense, it ain't good morals.  Ain't I right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I reck'n you are.  But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, then; come along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled\n",
      "forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse\n",
      "whisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a\n",
      "moan, and I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a\n",
      "gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set\n",
      "her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the\n",
      "wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix.  But if we find their\n",
      "boat we can put _all_ of 'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff 'll get 'em.\n",
      "Quick--hurry!  I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You\n",
      "start at the raft, and--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my lordy, lordy!  _raf'_?  Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she done broke\n",

      "CHAPTER XIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a wreck with\n",
      "such a gang as that!  But it warn't no time to be sentimentering.  We'd\n",
      "_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  So we went\n",
      "a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\n",
      "too--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jim\n",
      "said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't\n",
      "hardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we get left\n",
      "on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.  We struck\n",
      "for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\n",
      "forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the\n",
      "edge of the skylight was in the water.  When we got pretty close to the\n",
      "cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  I could just barely\n",
      "see her.  I felt ever so thankful.  In another second I would a been\n",
      "aboard of her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck his\n",
      "head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;\n",
      "but he jerked it in again, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and\n",
      "set down.  It was Packard.  Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.  Packard\n",
      "says, in a low voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“All ready--shove off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But Bill\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on--'d you go through him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.  Didn't you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.  So he's got his share o' the cash yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe he won't.  But we got to have it anyway. Come along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they got out and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half\n",
      "second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.  I out with my\n",
      "knife and cut the rope, and away we went!\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even\n",
      "breathe.  We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the\n",
      "paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a\n",
      "hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every\n",
      "last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern\n",
      "show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed\n",
      "by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to\n",
      "understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now was the\n",
      "first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't\n",
      "had time to before.  I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for\n",
      "murderers, to be in such a fix.  I says to myself, there ain't no\n",
      "telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would\n",
      "I like it?  So says I to Jim:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above\n",
      "it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and\n",
      "then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for\n",
      "that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when\n",
      "their time comes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,\n",
      "and this time worse than ever.  The rain poured down, and never a light\n",
      "showed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed along down the river,\n",
      "watching for lights and watching for our raft.  After a long time the\n",
      "rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,\n",
      "and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we\n",
      "made for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  We\n",
      "seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  So I said I would\n",
      "go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole\n",
      "there on the wreck.  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told\n",
      "Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone\n",
      "about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars\n",
      "and shoved for the light.  As I got down towards it three or four more\n",
      "showed--up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in above the shore\n",
      "light, and laid on my oars and floated.  As I went by I see it was a\n",
      "lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.  I skimmed\n",
      "around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and\n",
      "by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between\n",
      "his knees.  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to\n",
      "cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only\n",
      "me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, what's up?  Don't cry, bub.  What's the trouble?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pap, and mam, and sis, and--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I broke down.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, dang it now, _don't_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,\n",
      "and this 'n 'll come out all right.  What's the matter with 'em?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They're--they're--are you the watchman of the boat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  “I'm the captain\n",
      "and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head\n",
      "deck-hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers.  I ain't as\n",
      "rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' generous and good\n",
      "to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he\n",

      "_I'd_ live two mile out o' town, where there ain't nothing ever goin'\n",
      "on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it.  Says I--”\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't\n",

      "\n",
      "We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a\n",
      "monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.  She had\n",
      "four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty\n",
      "men, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open\n",
      "camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a\n",
      "power of style about her.  It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman\n",
      "on such a craft as that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got\n",
      "hot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on\n",
      "both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  We\n",
      "talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to\n",
      "it.  I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but\n",
      "about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit\n",
      "up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the two\n",
      "big rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybe\n",
      "we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the\n",
      "same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too.  So the question\n",
      "was, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,\n",
      "and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and\n",
      "was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to\n",
      "Cairo.  Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and\n",
      "waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and\n",
      "not pass it without seeing it.  He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,\n",
      "because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it\n",
      "he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.  Every\n",

      "\n",
      "“Dah she is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But it warn't.  It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set\n",
      "down again, and went to watching, same as before.  Jim said it made him\n",
      "all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.  Well, I can\n",
      "tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,\n",
      "because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and\n",
      "who was to blame for it?  Why, _me_.  I couldn't get that out of my\n",
      "conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't\n",
      "rest; I couldn't stay still in one place.  It hadn't ever come home to\n",
      "me before, what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and it\n",
      "stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make out to\n",
      "myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his\n",

      "that noway.  That was where it pinched.  Conscience says to me, “What\n",

      "got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to\n",

      "\n",

      "“Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell.”  Thinks I, this is what\n",

      "a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\n",
      "he's mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\n",
      "try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.  She\n",
      "was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\n",

      "out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining\n",
      "like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\n",
      "over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\n",
      "engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went\n",

      "minute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\n",
      "nearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\n",
      "my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and\n",
      "of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\n",
      "stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\n",

      "that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\n",
      "meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\n",
      "long time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up the\n",
      "bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\n",
      "rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a\n",
      "big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going to\n",

      "except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.  They\n",
      "all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.  The young women had\n",
      "quilts around them, and their hair down their backs.  They all asked me\n",
      "questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living\n",
      "on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann\n",
      "run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went\n",
      "to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,\n",
      "and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just\n",
      "trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died\n",
      "I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and\n",
      "started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how\n",

      "wanted it.  Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I\n",
      "went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,\n",
      "I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to\n",

      "\n",
      "I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it\n",

      "used to it.\n",

      "It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.  I hadn't\n",
      "seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much\n",
      "style.  It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one\n",
      "with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in\n",
      "town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps\n",
      "of parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that\n",
      "was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\n",
      "pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\n",
      "they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\n",
      "same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold\n",
      "up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\n",
      "a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\n",
      "a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\n",
      "pendulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;\n",
      "and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her\n",
      "up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred\n",
      "and fifty before she got tuckered out.  They wouldn't took any money for\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,\n",
      "made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.  By one of the\n",

      "and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open\n",
      "their mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through\n",
      "underneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\n",
      "behind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind\n",
      "of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\n",
      "grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\n",
      "than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where\n",
      "pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it\n",
      "was, underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\n",
      "blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It\n",
      "come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,\n",
      "too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a\n",
      "big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\n",
      "man that left his family, it didn't say why.  I read considerable in it\n",
      "now and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was\n",
      "Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't\n",
      "read the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.\n",
      "Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\n",
      "was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And\n",
      "there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged\n",
      "down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\n",
      "and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the\n",
      "Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the\n",
      "daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\n",
      "fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see\n",
      "before--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black\n",
      "dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\n",
      "the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\n",
      "a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\n",
      "very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\n",
      "tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\n",
      "hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\n",
      "and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.”\n",
      "  Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\n",
      "to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\n",
      "chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\n",
      "laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”\n",
      "  There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\n",
      "moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\n",
      "one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\n",
      "mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.”  These\n",
      "was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take\n",
      "to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\n",
      "fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\n",
      "more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\n",
      "what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was\n",
      "having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they\n",
      "said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\n",
      "every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\n",
      "done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman\n",
      "in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\n",
      "off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\n",
      "the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\n",
      "breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\n",
      "towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,\n",
      "and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\n",
      "before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\n",
      "head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\n",
      "flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young\n",
      "woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\n",
      "many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\n",
      "obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\n",
      "Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.\n",
      "It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name\n",

      "family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between\n",

      "alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some\n",
      "about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two\n",
      "myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow.  They kept Emmeline's\n",

      "\n",
      "Col.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all\n",
      "over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and\n",
      "that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas\n",
      "said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\n",
      "in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more\n",
      "quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and\n",
      "very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it\n",
      "anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and\n",
      "he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and\n",
      "a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\n",
      "deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\n",
      "you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and\n",
      "straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\n",
      "every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head\n",
      "to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;\n",
      "and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He\n",
      "carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn't no\n",
      "frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.  He was\n",
      "as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had\n",
      "confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\n",
      "straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\n",
      "flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\n",
      "and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn't ever have to\n",
      "tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered\n",
      "where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\n",
      "most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned\n",
      "into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was\n",
      "enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got\n",
      "up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again\n",
      "till they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where\n",
      "the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and\n",
      "he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and\n",
      "then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and _they_\n",
      "bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,\n",
      "all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and\n",
      "the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and\n",
      "give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad\n",
      "shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  They\n",
      "dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and\n",
      "wore broad Panama hats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud\n",
      "and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but\n",
      "when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,\n",
      "like her father.  She was beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She was\n",
      "gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too.  My nigger\n",

      "\n",
      "The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.\n",
      "Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or\n",
      "fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings\n",
      "round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods\n",
      "daytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly\n",
      "kinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was a\n",
      "handsome lot of quality, I tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six\n",
      "families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They was as high-toned\n",
      "and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.  The\n",
      "Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was\n",
      "about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a\n",

      "\n",
      "One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse\n",

      "“Quick!  Jump for the woods!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.  Pretty\n",
      "soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his\n",
      "horse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his gun across his\n",
      "pommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young Harney Shepherdson.  I\n",
      "heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his\n",
      "head.  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was\n",
      "hid.  But we didn't wait.  We started through the woods on a run.  The\n",
      "woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,\n",
      "and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away\n",
      "the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see.  We never\n",
      "stopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman's eyes blazed a\n",
      "minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed\n",
      "down, and he says, kind of gentle:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn't you step\n",

      "\n",

      "but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by\n",

      "judged that we was free and safe once more.  I hadn't had a bite to eat\n",
      "since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,\n",
      "and pork and cabbage and greens--there ain't nothing in the world so good\n",

      "Two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,\n",
      "they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put\n",
      "in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile\n",
      "and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\n",
      "night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always\n",
      "in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\n",
      "willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next\n",
      "we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\n",
      "off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\n",
      "deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly\n",
      "still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\n",
      "a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the\n",
      "water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you\n",
      "couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\n",
      "paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\n",
      "warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\n",
      "drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and\n",
      "long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\n",
      "jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\n",
      "by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\n",
      "streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\n",
      "and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\n",
      "of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\n",
      "log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of\n",
      "the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\n",
      "throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\n",
      "comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\n",
      "on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\n",
      "because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\n",
      "do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything\n",
      "smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\n",
      "\n",
      "A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch\n",
      "the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\n",
      "lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\n",
      "maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\n",
      "other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was\n",
      "a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be\n",
      "nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next\n",
      "you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\n",
      "chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the\n",
      "axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go\n",
      "up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the\n",
      "_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we\n",
      "would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once\n",
      "there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\n",
      "tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.  A scow or a\n",
      "raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\n",
      "laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made\n",
      "you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.\n",

      "“No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\n",
      "middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\n",
      "her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\n",
      "talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made\n",
      "for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on\n",
      "clothes, nohow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\n",
      "time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe\n",
      "a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water\n",
      "you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\n",
      "you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\n",
      "It's lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled\n",
      "with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and\n",
      "discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he\n",
      "allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would\n",
      "have took too long to _make_ so many.  Jim said the moon could a _laid_\n",
      "them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing\n",
      "against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\n",
      "could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\n",
      "streak down.  Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the\n",
      "nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\n",
      "dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\n",
      "of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\n",
      "pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\n",
      "her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\n",
      "waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\n",
      "raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't\n",
      "tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\n",
      "three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.\n",
      " These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant\n",
      "morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to\n",
      "the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile\n",
      "up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some\n",
      "berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed\n",
      "the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as\n",
      "they could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was\n",
      "after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim.  I was about to dig out\n",
      "from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung\n",
      "out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doing\n",
      "nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs\n",
      "a-coming.  They wanted to jump right in, but I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't you do it.  I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time\n",
      "to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you\n",
      "take to the water and wade down to me and get in--that'll throw the dogs\n",
      "off the scent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,\n",
      "and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,\n",
      "shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't\n",
      "see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got\n",
      "further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at\n",
      "all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the\n",
      "river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid\n",
      "in the cottonwoods and was safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head\n",
      "and very gray whiskers.  He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and\n",
      "a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed\n",
      "into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one.  He had\n",
      "an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over\n",
      "his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.  After\n",

      "_you_, gentlemen--far from it; I don't blame anybody.  I deserve it\n",
      "all.  Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there's a grave\n",
      "somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it's always done, and take\n",
      "everything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can't take\n",
      "that. Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken\n",

      "dying about the same time.  The second son of the late duke seized the\n",
      "titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored.  I am the lineal\n",

      "was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most\n",
      "anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.  He said we\n",
      "ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,”\n",
      " or “Your Lordship”--and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain\n",
      "“Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and\n",
      "one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for\n",
      "him he wanted done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood\n",
      "around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo' Grace have some o' dis or\n",

      "\n",
      "“Hold!  What do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of sobbing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the bitter death!”  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,\n",
      "and says, “That secret of your being:  speak!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”\n",
      "\n",
      "You bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke says:\n",

      "“You are what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very moment\n",

      "Sixteen and Marry Antonette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You!  At your age!  No!  You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you must\n",
      "be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung\n",
      "these gray hairs and this premature balditude.  Yes, gentlemen, you\n",
      "see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled,\n",
      "trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to\n",
      "do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too.\n",
      " So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort\n",
      "_him_. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done\n",
      "with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel\n",
      "easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his\n",
      "rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him\n",
      "“Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down\n",
      "in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,\n",
      "and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he\n",
      "told us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so he\n",
      "got cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, and\n",
      "didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,\n",
      "the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's\n",
      "great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good\n",
      "deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace\n",
      "considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the\n",
      "king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer\n",
      "raft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour?  It 'll only\n",
      "make things oncomfortable.  It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke,\n",
      "it ain't your fault you warn't born a king--so what's the use to worry?\n",
      " Make the best o' things the way you find 'em, says I--that's my motto.\n",
      " This ain't no bad thing that we've struck here--plenty grub and an easy\n",
      "life--come, give us your hand, duke, and le's all be friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  It took\n",
      "away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because\n",
      "it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the\n",
      "raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody\n",
      "to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no\n",
      "kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  But I\n",
      "never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;\n",
      "then you don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble.  If they\n",

      "No, they allowed he wouldn't.  I had to account for things some way, so\n",

      "\n",
      "“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and\n",
      "they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he 'lowed\n",
      "he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little\n",

      " Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched\n",
      "this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.\n",
      " Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of\n",
      "the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;\n",
      "Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four\n",
      "years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or\n",
      "two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in\n",

      "Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat\n",
      "lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was\n",
      "beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see\n",
      "that.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see\n",
      "what the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,\n",

      "hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain\n",
      "and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us\n",
      "to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke\n",
      "crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch\n",
      "below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,\n",
      "because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not\n",
      "by a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every\n",
      "second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half\n",
      "a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,\n",
      "and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!\n",
      "bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling\n",
      "and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and\n",
      "another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,\n",
      "but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind.  We didn't have no trouble\n",
      "about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant\n",

      "I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,\n",

      "and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for\n",
      "me; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and\n",
      "the waves warn't running so high now.  About two they come up again,\n",
      "though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because\n",
      "he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was\n",
      "mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.\n",
      "Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the\n",
      "difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight\n",
      "before she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled\n",
      "nightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was\n",
      "meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white\n",
      "cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king was\n",
      "satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the\n",
      "most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same\n",
      "time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the\n",
      "king and told him to get his part by heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\n",
      "after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run\n",
      "in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would\n",
      "go down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,\n",
      "too, and see if he couldn't strike something.  We was out of coffee, so\n",
      "Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and\n",
      "perfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunning\n",
      "himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young or\n",
      "too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the\n",
      "woods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that\n",
      "camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;\n",
      "a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and\n",
      "printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,\n",
      "littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of\n",
      "horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed\n",
      "his coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for\n",
      "the camp-meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most\n",
      "awful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there from\n",
      "twenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\n",
      "everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep\n",
      "off the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\n",
      "branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of\n",
      "watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\n",
      "bigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside\n",
      "slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into\n",
      "for legs. They didn't have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms\n",
      "to stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;\n",
      "and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the\n",
      "young ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and\n",
      "some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen\n",
      "shirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks\n",
      "was courting on the sly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined\n",
      "out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,\n",
      "there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\n",
      "he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up\n",
      "more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\n",
      "begun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to\n",
      "preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of\n",
      "the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front\n",
      "of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his\n",
      "words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\n",
      "his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\n",
      "that, shouting, “It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon\n",
      "it and live!”  And people would shout out, “Glory!--A-a-_men_!”  And so\n",
      "he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that's worn and\n",
      "soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite\n",
      "heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse\n",
      "is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!”\n",
      " (_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)\n",
      "\n",
      "And so on.  You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on\n",
      "account of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up everywheres in the\n",
      "crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners'\n",
      "bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the\n",
      "mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and\n",
      "shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\n",
      "over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and\n",
      "the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  He\n",
      "told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\n",
      "Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\n",
      "a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\n",
      "goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\n",
      "without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that\n",
      "ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for\n",
      "the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start\n",
      "right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest\n",
      "of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could\n",
      "do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews\n",
      "in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there\n",
      "without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced\n",
      "a pirate he would say to him, “Don't you thank me, don't you give me no\n",
      "credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,\n",
      "natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher\n",
      "there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.  Then somebody\n",
      "sings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!”  Well,\n",
      "a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let _him_\n",
      "pass the hat around!”  Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,\n",
      "and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being\n",
      "so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the\n",
      "prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would\n",
      "up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he\n",
      "always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or\n",
      "six times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to\n",
      "live in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said\n",
      "as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and\n",
      "besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to\n",
      "work on the pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\n",
      "collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.  And then he had\n",
      "fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\n",
      "wagon when he was starting home through the woods.  The king said,\n",
      "take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the\n",
      "missionarying line.  He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't\n",
      "amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come\n",
      "to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much.  He had set\n",
      "up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\n",
      "printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.  And he\n",
      "had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he\n",
      "said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so\n",
      "they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took\n",
      "in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them\n",
      "paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as\n",
      "usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the\n",
      "price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.\n",
      " He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of\n",
      "his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,\n",
      "“Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”--and he left that all set\n",
      "up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it.\n",
      " Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty\n",
      "square day's work for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged\n",
      "for, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with\n",
      "a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it.  The\n",
      "reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot.  It said\n",
      "he run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,\n",
      "last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send\n",
      "him back he could have the reward and expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the daytime if we\n",
      "want to.  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot\n",
      "with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we\n",
      "captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,\n",
      "so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down\n",
      "to get the reward.  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,\n",
      "but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor.  Too much\n",
      "like jewelry.  Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,\n",
      "as we say on the boards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no trouble\n",
      "about running daytimes.  We judged we could make miles enough that night\n",
      "to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in\n",
      "the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could\n",
      "boom right along if we wanted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten\n",
      "o'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn't\n",
      "hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis\n",
      "trip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” I says, “I reckon not.”\n",

      "He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year\n",

      "the crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,\n",
      "mighty ca'm and slow--he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock.  Till one\n",

      "after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns and goes in.  The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody\n",
      "stirred, and there warn't no more laughing.  Boggs rode off\n",
      "blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;\n",
      "and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping\n",
      "it up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,\n",
      "but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen\n",
      "minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn't\n",
      "do no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down\n",
      "in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down\n",
      "the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get\n",
      "a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they\n",
      "could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street\n",
      "he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and by\n",
      "somebody says:\n",

      "So somebody started on a run.  I walked down street a ways and stopped.\n",

      "horse.  He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with\n",
      "a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.\n",
      "He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but was\n",
      "doing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:\n",

      "“Boggs!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel\n",

      "the barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second I see a young\n",
      "girl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turned\n",
      "round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men\n",
      "jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to\n",
      "a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,\n",
      "“O Lord, don't shoot!”  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,\n",
      "clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards\n",

      "round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging\n",
      "to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,\n",
      "and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy.  It\n",
      "warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\n",

      "a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\n",
      "dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\n",
      "too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\n",
      "as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his\n",
      "clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up\n",
      "the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he\n",
      "was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you\n",
      "ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\n",
      "hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to\n",
      "the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and\n",
      "astonishment.\n",

      "the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the\n",
      "duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim\n",
      "he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few\n",
      "hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to\n",
      "lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him\n",
      "all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all\n",
      "by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway\n",
      "nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\n",
      "roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed\n",
      "Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\n",
      "white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\n",
      "and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\n",
      "dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.  Blamed if\n",
      "he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took\n",
      "and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\n",
      "foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight\n",
      "better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\n",
      "over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself\n",
      "free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\n",
      "out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\n",
      "a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\n",
      " Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\n",
      "wouldn't wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn't only look like he was\n",
      "dead, he looked considerable more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\n",

      "the news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn't hit no\n",
      "project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd\n",
      "lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up\n",
      "something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop\n",
      "over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence\n",
      "to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all\n",
      "bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n\n",
      "on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king's\n",
      "duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never\n",
      "knowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked\n",
      "like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off\n",
      "his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand\n",
      "and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,\n",
      "and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I\n",
      "got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away\n",
      "up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple\n",
      "of hours, taking on freight.  Says the king:\n",
      "\n",

      "scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.  Pretty soon we come to\n",
      "a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the\n",
      "sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a\n",
      "couple of big carpet-bags by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Run her nose in shore,” says the king.  I done it.  “Wher' you bound\n",

      "\n",

      "I see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap was\n",
      "mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.\n",
      "He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come\n",
      "down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he\n",
      "was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.  The\n",

      "“When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all\n",
      "right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn't\n",
      "mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything\n",
      "in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing\n",
      "else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys\n",
      "together--and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all--that's the deef\n",

      "time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to\n",
      "be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he\n",
      "was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem\n",
      "to care much to live.  He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and\n",
      "William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can't\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and they\n",
      "ain't going to let them come to no harm.  There's Hobson, the Babtis'\n",
      "preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,\n",
      "and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the\n",

      "Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied\n",

      "Peter's business--which was a tanner; and about George's--which was a\n",
      "carpenter; and about Harvey's--which was a dissentering minister; and so\n",
      "on, and so on.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop\n",
      "there.  When they're deep they won't stop for a hail.  A Cincinnati boat\n",
      "will, but this is a St. Louis one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was Peter Wilks well off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he\n",
      "left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When did you say he died?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn't say, but it was last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, 'bout the middle of the day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or\n",
      "another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, it's the best way.  Ma used to always say that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she\n",
      "got off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost\n",
      "my ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up\n",
      "another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\n",
      "carpet-bags.  And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and\n",
      "git him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  When\n",
      "I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a\n",
      "log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had\n",
      "said it--every last word of it.  And all the time he was a-doing it he\n",
      "tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for\n",
      "a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he\n",
      "really done it pretty good.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef\n",
      "and dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they waited for a\n",
      "steamboat.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,\n",
      "but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there\n",
      "was a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we went\n",
      "aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted\n",
      "to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and\n",
      "said they wouldn't land us.  But the king was ca'm.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and\n",
      "put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the\n",
      "village they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down when\n",
      "they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\n",
      "\n",

      "won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would\n",
      "make it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  No--I\n",
      "dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the\n",
      "money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it.  If she was to\n",
      "fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,\n",
      "I judge.  No; there ain't no good way but one.  I got to steal that\n",
      "money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion\n",
      "that I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going\n",
      "to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're\n",
      "worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and\n",
      "by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell\n",
      "Mary Jane where it's hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,\n",

      "\n",
      "So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall was\n",
      "dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with\n",
      "my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let\n",
      "anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to\n",
      "his room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn't do nothing\n",
      "without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course.  So I judged I'd\n",
      "got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.  About that time\n",
      "I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I\n",
      "reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched\n",
      "the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and\n",
      "snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\n",
      "\n",
      "They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to\n",
      "get down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed\n",
      "when I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under\n",
      "the bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, and\n",
      "the king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for\n",
      "us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a\n",

      "lighting out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That made me feel pretty bad.  About an hour or two ago it would a been\n",

      "\n",
      "“What!  And not sell out the rest o' the property?  March off like\n",

      "\n",

      "suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it--which\n",

      "\n",
      "“Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know\n",

      "\n",

      "I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned\n",
      "I was around.  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw\n",
      "tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two\n",
      "amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only\n",

      "could get a chance to do better.  I judged I better hide it outside\n",
      "of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the\n",
      "house a good ransacking:  I knowed that very well.  Then I turned in,\n",

      "little.  There warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on\n",

      "and making no more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved people\n",
      "around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done\n",
      "it with nods, and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place over\n",
      "against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever\n",

      "colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one\n",
      "that had a good thing, according to my notion.  Then the Reverend Hobson\n",
      "opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most\n",
      "outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only\n",
      "one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right\n",
      "along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you\n",
      "couldn't hear yourself think.  It was right down awkward, and nobody\n",

      "more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two\n",

      "we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or\n",
      "two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn\n",
      "talk where he left off.  In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's\n",
      "back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and\n",
      "glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his\n",
      "mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,\n",
      "over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “_He\n",

      "his place.  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,\n",

      "pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as\n",
      "soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.  So there I was!  I\n",
      "didn't know whether the money was in there or not.  So, says I, s'pose\n",

      "hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.  He was\n",
      "very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could\n",

      "that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed\n",
      "and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled\n",

      "I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd\n",

      "had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her\n",

      "eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out.  So I went to\n",

      "up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along\n",
      "and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the\n",
      "king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this\n",
      "town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what time o' day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the evenin'--'bout an hour er two before sundown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_How'd_ you come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_'--in a\n",
      "canoe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a lie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an\n",
      "old man and a preacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar.  He was up at the Pint\n",
      "that mornin'.  I live up there, don't I?  Well, I was up there, and\n",
      "he was up there.  I see him there.  He come in a canoe, along with Tim\n",
      "Collins and a boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor he up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I would, but I don't know.  Why, yonder he is, now.  I know\n",
      "him perfectly easy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was me he pointed at.  The doctor says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if\n",
      "_these_ two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all.  I think it's our\n",
      "duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into\n",
      "this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.  We'll take\n",
      "these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I\n",
      "reckon we'll find out _something_ before we get through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so\n",
      "we all started.  It was about sundown.  The doctor he led me along by\n",
      "the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and\n",
      "fetched in the new couple.  First, the doctor says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're\n",
      "frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about.\n",
      " If they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter\n",
      "Wilks left?  It ain't unlikely.  If these men ain't frauds, they won't\n",
      "object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove\n",
      "they're all right--ain't that so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody agreed to that.  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty\n",
      "tight place right at the outstart.  But the king he only looked\n",
      "sorrowful, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition\n",
      "to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation\n",
      "o' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send\n",
      "and see, if you want to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is it, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it\n",
      "inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few\n",
      "days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein'\n",
      "used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England.\n",
      " The niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down\n",
      "stairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got\n",
      "clean away with it.  My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn't altogether\n",
      "believe him.  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.  I said\n",
      "no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I\n",
      "never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up\n",
      "my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.\n",
      " That was all they asked me.  Then the doctor whirls on me and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are _you_ English, too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had\n",
      "it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about\n",
      "supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and\n",
      "kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They\n",
      "made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;\n",
      "and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the\n",
      "old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies.  And by and by\n",
      "they had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed\n",
      "look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\n",
      "right side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\n",
      "and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty\n",
      "fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you.  I reckon\n",
      "you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is\n",
      "practice.  You do it pretty awkward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,\n",
      "anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--” The king broke in and\n",
      "reached out his hand, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often\n",
      "about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked\n",
      "pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side\n",
      "and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“That 'll fix it.  I'll take the order and send it, along with your\n",
      "brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\n",
      "his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;\n",
      "and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the\n",
      "duke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer\n",
      "turns to the new old gentleman and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it.  The lawyer looked\n",
      "powerful astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it beats _me_”--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\n",
      "and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then\n",
      "_them_ again; and then says:  “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\n",
      "and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't\n",
      "write them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell\n",
      "you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here's _this_ old\n",
      "gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't\n",
      "write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at\n",
      "all.  Now, here's some letters from--”\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother\n",
      "there--so he copies for me.  It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Well_!” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things.  I've got some\n",
      "of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we\n",
      "can com--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He _can't_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman.  “If he\n",
      "could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\n",
      "and mine too.  Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer done it, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger\n",
      "resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I\n",
      "thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,\n",
      "partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em\n",
      "Wilkses”--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in\n",
      "_then_! Indeed he wouldn't.  Said it warn't no fair test.  Said his\n",
      "brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried\n",
      "to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\n",
      "he put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and\n",
      "warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\n",
      "saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay\n",
      "out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it.  We're both here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a\n",
      "squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\n",
      "him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\n",
      "most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\n",
      "notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\n",
      " He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in\n",
      "there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says\n",
      "I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.\n",
      " Well, did he?  A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.  I reckon\n",
      "he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\n",
      "they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\n",
      " Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mf!  It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k'n\n",
      "tell you what's tattooed on his breast.  It's jest a small, thin, blue\n",
      "arrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.\n",
      " _now_ what do you say--hey?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\n",
      "cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\n",
      "his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“There--you've heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter\n",
      "Wilks' breast?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them spoke up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We didn't see no such mark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” says the old gentleman.  “Now, what you _did_ see on his breast\n",
      "was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\n",
      "young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W”--and he marked\n",
      "them that way on a piece of paper.  “Come, ain't that what you saw?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them spoke up again, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, we _didn't_.  We never seen any marks at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds!  Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!\n",
      "le's ride 'em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there\n",
      "was a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,\n",
      "and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you\n",
      "_please_!  There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That took them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\n",
      "and the doctor sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch\n",
      "_them_ along, too!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don't find them marks we'll\n",
      "lynch the whole gang!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn't no getting away, you\n",
      "know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the\n",
      "graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole\n",
      "town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the\n",
      "evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;\n",
      "because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and\n",
      "blow on our dead-beats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like\n",
      "wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the\n",
      "lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst\n",
      "the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever\n",
      "was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from\n",
      "what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time\n",
      "if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to\n",
      "save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the\n",
      "world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If they\n",
      "didn't find them--\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think\n",
      "about nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful\n",
      "time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the\n",
      "wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He\n",
      "dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\n",
      "like an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had\n",
      "about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't\n",
      "thought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the\n",
      "flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a\n",
      "mile off, to borrow one.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain\n",
      "started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come\n",
      "brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took\n",
      "no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute\n",
      "you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the\n",
      "shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the\n",
      "dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then\n",
      "such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to\n",
      "scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it\n",
      "was awful.  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,\n",
      "and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and\n",
      "panting.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,\n",
      "and somebody sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and\n",
      "give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit\n",
      "out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all\n",
      "to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the\n",
      "buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of\n",
      "the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!\n",
      "\n",
      "When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so\n",
      "I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the\n",
      "main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and\n",
      "set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and\n",
      "disappointed, I didn't know why.  But at last, just as I was sailing by,\n",
      "_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up\n",
      "sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind\n",
      "me in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this\n",
      "world. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the\n",
      "towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first\n",
      "time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and\n",
      "shoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope.\n",
      " The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the\n",
      "middle of the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the\n",
      "raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp\n",
      "if I could afforded it.  But I didn't.  As I sprung aboard I sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!  Glory be to goodness, we're shut\n",
      "of them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so\n",
      "full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up\n",
      "in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King\n",
      "Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and\n",
      "lights out of me.  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and\n",
      "bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the\n",
      "king and the duke, but I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!  Cut loose and\n",
      "let her slide!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_\n",
      "seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and\n",
      "nobody to bother us.  I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack\n",
      "my heels a few times--I couldn't help it; but about the third crack\n",
      "I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and\n",
      "listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out\n",
      "over the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and\n",
      "making their skiff hum!  It was the king and the duke.\n",

      "them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  It was the\n",
      "first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and\n",

      "\n",
      "First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough\n",

      "half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\n",

      "over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break\n",
      "into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money\n",
      "business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an\n",
      "agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such\n",
      "actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold\n",
      "shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we\n",

      "hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the\n",
      "back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers\n",
      "bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all\n",

      "I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,\n",
      "up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call\n",
      "me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how\n",
      "good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling\n",
      "the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was\n",
      "the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's\n",
      "got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\n",
      "I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\n",
      "says to myself:\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell”--and tore it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let\n",
      "them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the\n",
      "whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\n",
      "which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.  And\n",
      "for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\n",
      "and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as\n",
      "long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\n",
      "suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\n",
      "raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the\n",
      "night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\n",
      "and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\n",
      "another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed\n",
      "below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\n",
      "and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\n",
      "sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\n",
      "of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\n",
      "it, “Phelps's Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn't mind,\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\n",
      "the village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,\n",
      "straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\n",
      "the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night\n",
      "performance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I\n",
      "was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hel-_lo_!  Where'd _you_ come from?”  Then he says, kind of glad and\n",
      "eager, “Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was your idea for asking _me_?” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\n",
      "to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went\n",
      "a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered\n",
      "me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\n",
      "a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\n",
      "and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\n",
      "along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\n",
      "him.  We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\n",
      "country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we\n",
      "fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and\n",
      "see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to\n",
      "leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in\n",
      "the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property\n",
      "no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and\n",
      "cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the\n",
      "raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft.  That old fool had\n",
      "made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\n",
      "the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\n",
      "what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\n",
      "found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and\n",
      "shook us, and run off down the river.'”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the\n",
      "world, and the only property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him\n",
      "_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble\n",
      "enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\n",
      "there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\n",
      "shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where's\n",
      "that ten cents? Give it here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\n",
      "spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\n",
      "money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never\n",
      "said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if he done\n",
      "that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's\n",
      "gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Sold_ him?”  I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, and\n",
      "that was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your\n",
      "blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?\n",
      " Blamed if I think I'd trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\n",
      "before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.\n",
      "I got to turn out and find my nigger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\n",
      "his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you'll\n",
      "promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you\n",
      "where to find him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I promised, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--” and then he stopped.  You see, he\n",
      "started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\n",
      "study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he\n",
      "was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\n",
      "the way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he\n",
      "lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days.  And I'll start this\n",
      "very afternoon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,\n",
      "neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in\n",
      "your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with\n",
      "_us_, d'ye hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I\n",
      "wanted to be left free to work my plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\n",
      "to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some\n",
      "idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down\n",
      "South here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,\n",
      "maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\n",
      "getting 'em out.  Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\n",
      "mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look around, but I\n",
      "kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out\n",
      "at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\n",
      "I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.  I\n",
      "reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\n",
      "around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could\n",
      "get away.  I didn't want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all I\n",

      "I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and\n",

      "of a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of\n",
      "fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses\n",

      "we can't let you walk.  And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on\n",

      "\n",
      "“You owdacious puppy!”\n",

      "They said you would, and I thought you would.  But--” He stopped and\n",
      "looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye\n",
      "somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, “Didn't\n",

      "\n",
      "“No, not till you've asked me first.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn't looking for _you_\n",

      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's because it warn't _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,” he\n",
      "says; “but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me\n",
      "come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a\n",
      "first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me\n",
      "to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But it\n",
      "was a mistake, Aunt Sally.  This ain't no healthy place for a stranger\n",
      "to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No--not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; I\n",

      "don't mind the terms--I'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to\n",
      "have you here. Well, to think of that performance!  I don't deny it, I\n",
      "was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and\n",
      "the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven\n",
      "families--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid\n",
      "in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of\n",
      "old cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long\n",
      "blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit,\n",
      "neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\n",
      " There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me\n",
      "and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they\n",
      "didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid\n",
      "to try to work up to it.  But at supper, at night, one of the little\n",
      "boys says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you\n",
      "couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and\n",
      "me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the\n",
      "people; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town\n",
      "before this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So there it was!--but I couldn't help it.  Tom and me was to sleep in the\n",
      "same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to\n",
      "bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the\n",
      "lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was\n",
      "going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up\n",
      "and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,\n",
      "and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and\n",
      "what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our\n",
      "Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had\n",
      "time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of\n",
      "it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of\n",
      "people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin\n",

      "\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\n",

      "as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at\n",
      "the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and\n",
      "searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\n",
      "so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,\n",
      "and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\n",
      "and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection\n",
      "with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\n",
      "some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\n",
      " The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and\n",
      "the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;\n",

      "“Now we're all right.  We'll _dig_ him out.  It 'll take about a week!”\n",
      "\n",

      "to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that\n",
      "warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\n",
      "climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three\n",
      "times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\n",
      "busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he\n",

      "\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\n",

      "_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through\n",
      "breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up\n",
      "a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was\n",
      "leaving, the key come from the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\n",
      "all tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches\n",
      "off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\n",
      "long before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so\n",
      "about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\n",

      "we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure\n",
      "enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, _Huck_!  En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn't know\n",
      "nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger\n",
      "busted in and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and\n",

      "\n",

      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, that's mighty curious.  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?\n",
      " _what_ did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,\n",
      "“Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\n",
      "and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you sing out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain't said nothing, sah.”\n",

      "says, kind of severe:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway?  What made you think\n",

      "advertise Jim, or something like that.  So we can't resk being as long\n",
      "digging him out as we ought to.  By rights I reckon we ought to be\n",
      "a couple of years; but we can't.  Things being so uncertain, what I\n",
      "recommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;\n",
      "and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it\n",
      "thirty-seven years.  Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the\n",

      "pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the\n",
      "way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom\n",

      "when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there\n",

      " So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then\n",

      "they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and\n",
      "we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,\n",

      "rush; we ain't got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another\n",

      "out with the picks, and _let on_ it's case-knives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Now_ you're _talking_!”  I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler\n",

      " When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school\n",

      "and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,\n",

      "\n",
      "I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around\n",

      "it and went to work, and never said a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\n",
      "and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as\n",
      "long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for\n",
      "it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing\n",
      "his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his\n",
      "hands was so sore.  At last he says:\n",
      "\n",

      "you think of no way?”\n",

      "let on it's a lightning-rod.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,\n",
      "for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I\n",

      "plates.  Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see\n",
      "the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel\n",
      "and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and\n",
      "he could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:\n",

      "\n",
      "“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard\n",

      "said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to\n",
      "decide on any of them yet.  Said we'd got to post Jim first.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\n",
      "one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard\n",
      "Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him.  Then we\n",
      "whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\n",
      "the job was done.  We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and\n",
      "pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,\n",
      "and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle\n",

      "honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us\n",
      "hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,\n",
      "and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how\n",
      "unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,\n",
      "and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and\n",
      "not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\n",
      " So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\n",

      "him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt\n",
      "Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and\n",
      "both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\n",

      "on.  It was his way when he'd got his plans set.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other\n",
      "large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the\n",
      "lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and\n",
      "we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them\n",
      "out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her\n",
      "apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and\n",
      "what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with\n",
      "his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn't see\n",
      "no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\n",
      "better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\n",
      "as Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\n",
      "sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\n",
      "bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.  Tom was in high\n",
      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\n",
      "keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\n",
      "get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\n",
      "more he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out\n",
      "to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he\n",
      "said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\n",
      "candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\n",
      "his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's\n",
      "notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\n",
      "corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\n",
      "it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\n",
      "mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked\n",

      "in there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to\n",

      "over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was\n",
      "dying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat,\n",
      "and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back\n",
      "again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.\n",
      "Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and\n",

      "the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other,\n",
      "looking as absent-minded as year before last.  He went a mooning around,\n",
      "first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all.\n",
      " Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle\n",
      "and thinking.  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it.  I could\n",

      "we'd got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had ciphered it out\n",
      "he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the\n",
      "spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to\n",
      "counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of\n",
      "them up my sleeve, and Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons _yet_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me.  I know better, I counted\n",
      "'m myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody\n",
      "would.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!” she says.  “Why, what in\n",
      "the world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now!” and she looked huffy\n",
      "and bothered both.  But Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You numskull, didn't you see me _count 'm?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know, but--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I'll count 'm _again_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\n",
      " Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so\n",
      "mad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start\n",
      "to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they\n",
      "come out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed\n",
      "up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\n",
      "galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if\n",
      "we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin\n",
      "us.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst\n",
      "she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along\n",
      "with her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with\n",
      "this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\n",
      "because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike\n",
      "again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if\n",
      "she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the\n",
      "next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody\n",
      "that wanted her to ever count them any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\n",
      "her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\n",
      "couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\n",
      "and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\n",
      "soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;\n",
      "she druther die first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\n",
      "and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\n",
      "counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would\n",
      "blow over by and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We\n",
      "fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\n",
      "done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\n",
      "had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and\n",
      "we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with\n",
      "the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we\n",
      "couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course\n",
      "we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,\n",
      "in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore\n",
      "up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long\n",
      "before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person\n",
      "with.  We let on it took nine months to make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go\n",

      "and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in\n",
      "a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and\n",
      "a rattling good honest day's work:  and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!\n",
      " And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn't\n",
      "half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn't\n",
      "matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.  So\n",
      "we judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn't no real\n",
      "scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.  You'd see\n",
      "them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they\n",
      "generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most\n",
      "of the time where you didn't want them.  Well, they was handsome and\n",
      "striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never\n",
      "made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what\n",
      "they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and\n",
      "every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference\n",
      "what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.  I\n",
      "never see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You\n",
      "couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And if\n",
      "she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a\n",
      "howl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old\n",
      "man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes\n",
      "created.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the\n",
      "house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't\n",
      "near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could\n",
      "touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump\n",
      "right out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all\n",
      "women was just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason or\n",
      "other.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she\n",
      "allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever\n",
      "loaded up the place again with them.  I didn't mind the lickings,\n",
      "because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we\n",
      "had to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other\n",
      "things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd\n",
      "all swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders,\n",
      "and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it\n",
      "mighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes\n",
      "and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and\n",
      "when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was\n",
      "always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but\n",
      "took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and\n",
      "when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one\n",
      "gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,\n",
      "and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at\n",
      "him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't\n",
      "ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.\n",
      " The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he\n",
      "would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;\n",
      "the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the\n",
      "grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,\n",
      "and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all\n",
      "going to die, but didn't.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever\n",
      "see; and Tom said the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was\n",
      "all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The old man had wrote\n",
      "a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their\n",
      "runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such\n",
      "plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and\n",
      "New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me\n",
      "the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now\n",
      "for the nonnamous letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's them?”  I says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it's done one\n",
      "way, sometimes another.  But there's always somebody spying around that\n",
      "gives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going\n",
      "to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It's a very good\n",
      "way, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We'll use them both.  And it's\n",
      "usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she\n",
      "stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.  We'll do that, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that\n",
      "something's up?  Let them find it out for themselves--it's their\n",
      "lookout.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them.  It's the way they've acted\n",
      "from the very start--left us to do _everything_.  They're so confiding\n",
      "and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all.  So if we\n",
      "don't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere\n",
      "with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I ain't going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits\n",
      "me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she\n",
      "prob'bly hain't got any but that one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the\n",

      "\n",
      "“All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my\n",

      "\n",
      "“You wouldn't look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That ain't got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just\n",
      "to do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or\n",
      "not. Hain't you got no principle at all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl.  Who's Jim's\n",
      "mother?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not much.  I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed\n",
      "to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's\n",
      "gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together.  When a\n",
      "prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion.  It's always called\n",
      "so when a king escapes, f'rinstance.  And the same with a king's son;\n",
      "it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural\n",
      "one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's\n",
      "frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the\n",

      "a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said “ouch!” if anything fell,\n",
      "she jumped and said “ouch!” if you happened to touch her, when she\n",
      "warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be\n",
      "satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every\n",
      "time--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying “ouch,” and\n",
      "before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it\n",
      "again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up.  So the\n",

      "more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the\n",
      "streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we\n",
      "better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going\n",
      "to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the\n",
      "lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,\n",

      "along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the\n",
      "nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn\n",
      "if I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as\n",
      "they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his\n",

      "about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her\n",
      "back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good\n",

      "\n",
      "So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as\n",
      "a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of\n",
      "corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs\n",
      "very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes\n",
      "Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped\n",
      "my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:\n",

      "s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat\n",
      "about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,\n",

      "So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.\n",
      "My, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of them\n",

      "seats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn't easy myself, but I\n",
      "didn't take my hat off, all the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if\n",

      "the color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,\n",
      "dear, whyd'nt you _tell_ me that was what you'd been down there for, I\n",
      "wouldn't a cared.  Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of\n",
      "you till morning!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,\n",
      "and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I couldn't hardly get my\n",

      "jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,\n",
      "with guns!\n",
      "\n",
      "His eyes just blazed; and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!--is that so?  _ain't_ it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was to do over\n",
      "again, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could put it off till--”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.\n",

      "sheep-signal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them\n",
      "begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _told_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.\n",
      "Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the\n",
      "dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,\n",
      "and listen if you can hear 'em coming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on\n",
      "us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all\n",
      "right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,\n",
      "and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders.  Now we was in the\n",
      "lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door,\n",
      "and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make\n",
      "out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen\n",
      "for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out\n",
      "first, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and\n",
      "listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all\n",
      "the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,\n",
      "not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\n",
      "towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim\n",
      "over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top\n",
      "rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which\n",
      "snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks\n",
      "and started somebody sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's that?  Answer, or I'll shoot!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there\n",
      "was a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed\n",
      "around us! We heard them sing out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here they are!  They've broke for the river!  After 'em, boys, and turn\n",

      "something for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never\n",
      "do nothing to grieve her any more.  And the third time I waked up at\n",

      "The old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no\n",
      "track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying\n",
      "nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not\n",
      "eating anything. And by and by the old man says:\n",

      "“Why, it's from St. Petersburg--it's from Sis.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir.  But\n",
      "before she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see\n",
      "something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old\n",
      "doctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;\n",
      "and a lot of people.  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come\n",
      "handy, and rushed.  She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:\n",

      "“Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,\n",

      "\n",
      "“He's alive, thank God!  And that's enough!” and she snatched a kiss of\n",

      "right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue\n",
      "could go, every jump of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the\n",

      "was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to\n",
      "all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run\n",
      "away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a\n",
      "whole family scared most to death for days and nights.  But the others\n",
      "said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and\n",
      "his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled\n",
      "them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious\n",

      "\n",
      "They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the\n",

      "on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to\n",
      "a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and\n",
      "both legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to\n",
      "eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because\n",
      "he didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and\n",
      "said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the\n",

      "about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with\n",

      "to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  It\n",
      "was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and\n",
      "of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't,\n",
      "because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet\n",
      "never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stick\n",

      "better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,\n",
      "and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked\n",
      "main hard lately.  I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a\n",
      "nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too.  I\n",
      "had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he\n",

      "would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped\n",
      "on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped\n",
      "up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was\n",
      "about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a\n",
      "flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and\n",
      "towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least\n",

      "that's what I think about him.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful\n",
      "to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was\n",
      "according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good\n",
      "heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then they\n",
      "all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some\n",
      "notice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right out\n",
      "and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he\n",
      "could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten\n",
      "heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they\n",
      "didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but\n",
      "I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as\n",
      "soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of\n",
      "me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot\n",

      "around hunting the runaway nigger.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day\n",

      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt\n",

      "found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that\n",
      "would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and\n",
      "pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and\n",
      "laid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding\n",
      "in, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and\n",
      "set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful\n",
      "now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping\n",
      "like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the\n",
      "time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his\n",

      "\n",
      "“Good!  Splendid!  _Now_ we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  “About what, Sid?”\n",

      " And we done it elegant, too.”  He'd got a start, and she never checked\n",
      "him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and\n",
      "I see it warn't no use for _me_ to put in.  “Why, Aunty, it cost us a\n",
      "power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was\n",
      "all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,\n",
      "and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the\n",

      "inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think _half_ the\n",
      "fun it was.  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,\n",
      "and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the\n",
      "lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder\n",

      "went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the\n",

      "\n",
      "“I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, _I'll_\n",
      "go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.  Old Miss\n",
      "Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to\n",
      "sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her\n",

      "If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as\n",
      "sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and\n",
      "cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,\n",
      "for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  And I peeped\n",
      "out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and\n",
      "stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding\n",
      "him into the earth, you know.  And then she says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, you _better_ turn y'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally; “_Is_ he changed so?  Why, that ain't\n",

      "\n",
      "So I done it.  But not feeling brash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever\n",
      "see--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told\n",
      "it all to him.  It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't\n",
      "know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting\n",
      "sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the\n",
      "oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it.  So Tom's Aunt Polly,\n",
      "she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how\n",
      "I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom\n",
      "Sawyer--she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm\n",
      "used to it now, and 'tain't no need to change”--that when Aunt Sally took\n",
      "me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn't no other way, and\n",
      "I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being\n",
      "a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly\n",
      "satisfied.  And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made\n",
      "things as soft as he could for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting\n",
      "Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took\n",
      "all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't\n",
      "ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_\n",
      "help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and\n",
      "_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go off that\n",
      "way without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go and trapse all\n",
      "the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that\n",
      "creetur's up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any\n",

      "\n",
      "There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the\n",

      "that things in general were settled for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\n",
      "Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,\n",
      "as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth\n",
      "blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had\n",

      "messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally\n",
      "deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the\n",

      "France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\n",

      "rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which\n",
      "the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of\n",
      "the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work\n",
      "unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about\n",
      "with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion\n",
      "that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\n",
      "justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\n",
      "highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;\n",
      "families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing\n",
      "their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman\n",

      "then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the\n",
      "failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;\n",
      "that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\n",

      "gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law\n",
      "fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;\n",
      "thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at\n",
      "Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search\n",
      "for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the\n",
      "musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences\n",
      "much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy\n",

      "up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on\n",
      "Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the\n",
      "hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of\n",
      "Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,\n",

      "those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the\n",
      "fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights\n",
      "with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred\n",

      "hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a\n",
      "nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\n",
      "forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding\n",
      "none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the\n",
      "air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\n",
      "waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out\n",
      "everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\n",
      "and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\n",
      "into it, as if they had made it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the\n",
      "side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the\n",
      "ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from\n",
      "anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\n",
      "hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\n",
      "the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers\n",
      "were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on\n",
      "the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,\n",
      "when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in\n",
      "“the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable\n",
      "non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard\n",
      "of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one\n",
      "thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as\n",
      "he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\n",
      "and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\n",
      "loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\n",
      "deposited on a substratum of cutlass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected\n",
      "the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they\n",
      "all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but\n",
      "the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have\n",
      "taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the\n",
      "journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re at the\n",
      "top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to\n",
      "it!--Joe!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa!” the guard replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter’s\n",
      "yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,\n",
      "made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed\n",
      "suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its\n",
      "passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach\n",
      "stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three\n",
      "had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead\n",
      "into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of\n",
      "getting shot instantly as a highwayman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses\n",
      "stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for\n",
      "the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his\n",
      "box.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you say, Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They both listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold\n",
      "of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “Gentlemen! In the king’s\n",
      "name, all of you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on\n",
      "the offensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;\n",
      "the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He\n",
      "remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained\n",
      "in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,\n",
      "and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked\n",
      "back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up\n",
      "his ears and looked back, without contradicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring\n",
      "of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet\n",
      "indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to\n",
      "the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the\n",
      "passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the\n",
      "quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding\n",
      "the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there! Stand!\n",
      "I shall fire!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,\n",
      "a man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Is_ that the Dover mail?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you want to know?”\n",

      "“I want a passenger, if it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What passenger?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Jarvis Lorry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,\n",
      "the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,\n",
      "“because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in\n",
      "your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering\n",
      "speech. “Who wants me? Is it Jerry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“I don’t like Jerry’s voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to\n",
      "himself. “He’s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. Lorry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?”\n",

      "“A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the\n",
      "road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two\n",
      "passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and\n",
      "pulled up the window. “He may come close; there’s nothing wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ‘Nation sure of that,” said the\n",
      "guard, in gruff soliloquy. “Hallo you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you’ve got holsters to that\n",
      "saddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ’em. For I’m a devil\n",
      "at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So\n",
      "now let’s look at you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,\n",
      "and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider\n",
      "stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger\n",
      "a small folded paper. The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse and\n",
      "rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of\n",
      "the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised\n",
      "blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,\n",

      "\n",
      "“There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson’s Bank. You must\n",

      "\n",
      "“If so be as you’re quick, sir.”\n",

      "read--first to himself and then aloud: “‘Wait at Dover for Mam’selle.’\n",
      "It’s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED\n",
      "TO LIFE.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerry started in his saddle. “That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,”\n",
      " said he, at his hoarsest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as\n",
      "well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at\n",
      "all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted\n",
      "their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general\n",
      "pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape\n",
      "the hazard of originating any other kind of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round\n",
      "it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss\n",
      "in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and\n",
      "having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,\n",
      "looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a\n",
      "few smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was\n",
      "furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown\n",
      "and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut\n",
      "himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,\n",
      "and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in\n",
      "five minutes.\n",

      "A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is\n",

      "solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every\n",
      "one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every\n",
      "room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating\n",
      "heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of\n",
      "its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the\n",
      "awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I\n",
      "turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time\n",
      "to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable\n",
      "water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses\n",

      "eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood\n",
      "in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,\n",
      "my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable\n",
      "consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that\n",

      "own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that\n",
      "assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with\n",
      "no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they\n",
      "were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too\n",
      "far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like\n",
      "a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and\n",
      "throat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees. When he stopped\n",
      "for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he\n",

      "coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the\n",
      "bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great\n",
      "stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,\n",
      "and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson’s, with\n",
      "all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then\n",

      "safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach\n",

      "always with him, there was another current of impression that never\n",
      "ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one\n",
      "out of a grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him\n",

      "not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by\n",
      "years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,\n",
      "and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,\n",
      "defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;\n",
      "so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands\n",
      "and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was\n",

      " Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,\n",
      "“Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it\n",
      "was, “I don’t know her. I don’t understand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,\n",

      "hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth\n",

      "patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating\n",

      "of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the\n",
      "real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express\n",
      "sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out\n",
      "of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost\n",
      "it again.\n",

      "When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,\n",
      "the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his\n",
      "custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey\n",
      "from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous\n",
      "traveller upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be\n",
      "congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective\n",
      "roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp\n",
      "and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather\n",
      "like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out\n",
      "of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and\n",
      "muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The\n",
      "tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,\n",
      "sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.\n",
      "Show Concord! Gentleman’s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off\n",
      "gentleman’s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)\n",
      "Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the\n",
      "mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from\n",
      "head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the\n",
      "Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,\n",
      "all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another\n",
      "drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all\n",
      "loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord\n",
      "and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a\n",
      "brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large\n",
      "square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to\n",
      "his breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman\n",
      "in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,\n",
      "with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,\n",
      "that he might have been sitting for his portrait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a\n",
      "loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,\n",
      "as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and\n",
      "evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain\n",
      "of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a\n",
      "fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He\n",
      "wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his\n",
      "head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which\n",
      "looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.\n",
      "His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,\n",
      "was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring\n",
      "beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A\n",
      "face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the\n",
      "quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost\n",
      "their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and\n",
      "reserved expression of Tellson’s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his\n",
      "cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.\n",
      "But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson’s Bank were\n",
      "principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps\n",
      "second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,\n",
      "Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,\n",
      "and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any\n",
      "time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a\n",
      "gentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in\n",

      "vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company’s House.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,\n",
      "sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last\n",
      "from France.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people’s\n",
      "time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and\n",
      "Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen\n",
      "years ago?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from\n",
      "the truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, sir!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the\n",
      "table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,\n",
      "dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while\n",
      "he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the\n",
      "immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on\n",
      "the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away\n",
      "from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine\n",
      "ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling\n",
      "wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was\n",
      "destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and\n",
      "brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong\n",
      "a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be\n",
      "dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little\n",
      "fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by\n",
      "night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide\n",
      "made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,\n",
      "sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable\n",
      "that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been\n",
      "at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became\n",
      "again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry’s thoughts seemed to cloud\n",
      "too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting\n",
      "his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,\n",
      "digging, digging, in the live red coals.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no\n",
      "harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.\n",
      "Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last\n",
      "glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is\n",
      "ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has\n",
      "got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow\n",
      "street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "He set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam’selle!” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette\n",
      "had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from\n",
      "Tellson’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So soon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none\n",
      "then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson’s\n",
      "immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman from Tellson’s had nothing left for it but to empty his\n",
      "glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen\n",
      "wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette’s apartment.\n",
      "It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black\n",
      "horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and\n",
      "oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room\n",
      "were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep\n",
      "graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected\n",
      "from them until they were dug out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his\n",
      "way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for\n",
      "the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall\n",
      "candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and\n",
      "the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,\n",
      "and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As\n",
      "his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden\n",
      "hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and\n",
      "a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth\n",
      "it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was\n",
      "not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright\n",
      "fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his\n",
      "eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,\n",
      "of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very\n",
      "Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran\n",
      "high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of\n",
      "the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital\n",
      "procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were\n",
      "offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the\n",
      "feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a\n",
      "little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier\n",
      "date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that\n",
      "some intelligence--or discovery--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so\n",
      "long dead--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the\n",
      "hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for\n",
      "anybody in their absurd baskets!\n",
      "\n",
      "“--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate\n",
      "with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for\n",
      "the purpose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I was prepared to hear, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a\n",
      "pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he\n",
      "was than she. He made her another bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by\n",
      "those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to\n",
      "France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with\n",
      "me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,\n",
      "during the journey, under that worthy gentleman’s protection. The\n",
      "gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to\n",
      "beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. I shall\n",
      "be more happy to execute it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me\n",
      "by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the\n",
      "business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising\n",
      "nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a\n",
      "strong and eager interest to know what they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. “Yes--I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the\n",
      "ears, “It is very difficult to begin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young\n",
      "forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty\n",
      "and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,\n",
      "as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing\n",
      "shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with\n",
      "an argumentative smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of\n",
      "which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression\n",
      "deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which\n",
      "she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the\n",
      "moment she raised her eyes again, went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you\n",
      "as a young English lady, Miss Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you please, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to\n",
      "acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than\n",
      "if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with\n",
      "your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Story!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,\n",
      "in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call\n",
      "our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific\n",

      "\n",
      "“At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and\n",
      "I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other\n",
      "French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson’s hands.\n",
      "In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for\n",
      "scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;\n",
      "there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like\n",
      "sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my\n",
      "business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in\n",
      "the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere\n",
      "machine. To go on--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But this is my father’s story, sir; and I begin to think”--the\n",

      "the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub\n",
      "his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking\n",
      "down into her face while she sat looking up into his.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself\n",
      "just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold\n",
      "with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect\n",
      "that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of\n",
      "Tellson’s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of\n",
      "Tellson’s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance\n",
      "of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary\n",

      "\n",
      "After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry\n",
      "flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most\n",

      "The Wine-shop\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The\n",
      "accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled\n",
      "out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just\n",
      "outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their\n",
      "idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular\n",
      "stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have\n",
      "thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,\n",
      "had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own\n",
      "jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,\n",
      "made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help\n",
      "women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all\n",
      "run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in\n",
      "the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with\n",
      "handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’\n",
      "mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;\n",
      "others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and\n",
      "there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new\n",
      "directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed\n",
      "pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted\n",
      "fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the\n",
      "wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up\n",
      "along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,\n",
      "if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous\n",
      "presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,\n",
      "and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There\n",
      "was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a\n",
      "special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part\n",
      "of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the\n",
      "luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,\n",
      "shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen\n",
      "together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been\n",
      "most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these\n",
      "demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who\n",
      "had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in\n",
      "motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of\n",
      "hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own\n",
      "starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men\n",
      "with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into\n",
      "the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom\n",
      "gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street\n",
      "in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had\n",
      "stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many\n",
      "wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks\n",
      "on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was\n",
      "stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.\n",
      "Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a\n",
      "tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his\n",
      "head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled\n",
      "upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the\n",
      "street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary\n",
      "gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was\n",
      "heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in\n",
      "waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;\n",
      "but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a\n",
      "terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the\n",
      "fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,\n",
      "passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered\n",
      "in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which\n",
      "had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the\n",
      "children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the\n",
      "grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,\n",
      "was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out\n",
      "of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and\n",
      "lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and\n",
      "paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of\n",
      "firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless\n",
      "chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,\n",
      "among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the\n",
      "baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of\n",
      "bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that\n",
      "was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting\n",
      "chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every\n",
      "farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant\n",
      "drops of oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding\n",
      "street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets\n",
      "diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags\n",
      "and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them\n",
      "that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some\n",
      "wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and\n",
      "slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor\n",
      "compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted\n",
      "into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or\n",
      "inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)\n",
      "were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman\n",
      "painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of\n",
      "meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,\n",
      "croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were\n",
      "gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a\n",
      "flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives\n",
      "and axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and the\n",
      "gunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,\n",
      "with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but\n",
      "broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down\n",
      "the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy\n",
      "rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across\n",
      "the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and\n",
      "pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,\n",
      "and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly\n",
      "manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and\n",
      "the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region\n",
      "should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so\n",
      "long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling\n",
      "up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their\n",
      "condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over\n",
      "France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of\n",
      "song and feather, took no warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its\n",
      "appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside\n",
      "it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle\n",
      "for the lost wine. “It’s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug\n",
      "of the shoulders. “The people from the market did it. Let them bring\n",
      "another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,\n",
      "he called to him across the way:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often\n",
      "the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is\n",
      "often the way with his tribe too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wine-shop\n",
      "keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of\n",
      "mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. “Why do you write\n",
      "in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place\n",
      "to write such words in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,\n",
      "perhaps not) upon the joker’s heart. The joker rapped it with his\n",
      "own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing\n",
      "attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his\n",
      "hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly\n",
      "practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put it on, put it on,” said the other. “Call wine, wine; and finish\n",
      "there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker’s\n",
      "dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on\n",
      "his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,\n",
      "and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a\n",
      "bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.\n",
      "His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to\n",
      "the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own\n",
      "crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good\n",
      "eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on\n",
      "the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong\n",
      "resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing\n",
      "down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn\n",
      "the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he\n",
      "came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with\n",
      "a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand\n",
      "heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of\n",
      "manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might\n",
      "have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself\n",
      "in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being\n",
      "sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright\n",
      "shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large\n",
      "earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick\n",
      "her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported\n",
      "by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but\n",
      "coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting\n",
      "of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a\n",
      "line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the\n",

      "a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing\n",
      "dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply\n",
      "of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the\n",

      "to himself; “I don’t know you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse\n",
      "with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. “Is\n",
      "all the spilt wine swallowed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,\n",
      "picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,\n",
      "and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or\n",
      "of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still\n",
      "using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of\n",
      "cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty\n",
      "drinking vessel and smacked his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle\n",
      "always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I\n",
      "right, Jacques?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment\n",
      "when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and\n",
      "slightly rustled in her seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold then! True!” muttered her husband. “Gentlemen--my wife!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three\n",
      "flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and\n",
      "giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the\n",
      "wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose\n",
      "of spirit, and became absorbed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly\n",
      "upon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you\n",
      "wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the\n",
      "fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard\n",
      "close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of\n",
      "my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been\n",
      "there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly\n",
      "gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to\n",
      "the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first\n",
      "word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had\n",
      "not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then\n",
      "beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge\n",
      "knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,\n",
      "joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own\n",
      "company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,\n",
      "and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited\n",
      "by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the\n",
      "gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee\n",
      "to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was\n",
      "a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable\n",
      "transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour\n",
      "in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,\n",
      "angry, dangerous man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.”\n",
      " Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began\n",
      "ascending the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he alone?” the latter whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alone! God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in the\n",
      "same low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he always alone, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of his own desire?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they\n",
      "found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be\n",
      "discreet--as he was then, so he is now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is greatly changed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Changed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,\n",
      "and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so\n",
      "forcible. Mr. Lorry’s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his\n",
      "two companions ascended higher and higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded\n",
      "parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile\n",
      "indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation\n",
      "within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,\n",
      "the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general\n",
      "staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides\n",
      "flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and\n",
      "hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted\n",
      "the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their\n",
      "intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost\n",
      "insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt\n",
      "and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to\n",
      "his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.\n",
      "Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made\n",
      "at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left\n",
      "uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed\n",
      "to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were\n",
      "caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer\n",
      "or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any\n",
      "promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the\n",
      "third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination\n",
      "and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story\n",
      "was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in\n",
      "advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he\n",
      "dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about\n",
      "here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over\n",
      "his shoulder, took out a key.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay. Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered it\n",
      "closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be\n",
      "frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what\n",
      "harm--if his door was left open.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly. “Yes. And a beautiful\n",
      "world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things\n",
      "are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under\n",
      "that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word\n",
      "of it had reached the young lady’s ears. But, by this time she trembled\n",
      "under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,\n",
      "and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent\n",
      "on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a\n",
      "moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,\n",
      "all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you\n",
      "bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.\n",
      "That’s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were\n",
      "soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at\n",
      "once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at\n",
      "the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which\n",
      "the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing\n",
      "footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed\n",
      "themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the\n",
      "wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge. “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three glided by, and went silently down.\n",
      "\n",
      "There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of\n",
      "the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ think it is well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are the few? How do you choose them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the\n",
      "sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another\n",
      "thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in\n",
      "through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck\n",
      "twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to\n",
      "make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,\n",
      "three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned\n",
      "it as heavily as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the\n",
      "room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more\n",
      "than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry\n",
      "got his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for he\n",
      "felt that she was sinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of\n",
      "business shining on his cheek. “Come in, come in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of it? What?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean of him. Of my father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of\n",
      "their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his\n",
      "shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her\n",
      "down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,\n",
      "took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,\n",
      "methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he\n",
      "could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to\n",
      "where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.\n",
      "\n",
      "The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim\n",
      "and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the\n",
      "roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from\n",
      "the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any\n",
      "other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this\n",
      "door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.\n",
      "Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it\n",
      "was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit\n",
      "alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work\n",
      "requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being\n",
      "done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face\n",
      "towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at\n",
      "him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very\n",
      "busy, making shoes.\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER VI.\n",
      "The Shoemaker\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that\n",
      "bent low over the shoemaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the\n",
      "salutation, as if it were at a distance:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are still hard at work, I see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the\n",
      "voice replied, “Yes--I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard eyes\n",
      "had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the\n",
      "faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no\n",
      "doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was\n",
      "the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo\n",
      "of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and\n",
      "resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once\n",
      "beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and\n",
      "suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive\n",
      "it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,\n",
      "wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered\n",
      "home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked\n",
      "up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical\n",
      "perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were\n",
      "aware of had stood, was not yet empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,\n",
      "“to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,\n",
      "at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the\n",
      "other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can bear a little more light?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a\n",
      "stress upon the second word.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that\n",
      "angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and\n",
      "showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his\n",
      "labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his\n",
      "feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very\n",
      "long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and\n",
      "thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet\n",
      "dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really\n",
      "otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.\n",
      "His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body\n",
      "to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose\n",
      "stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion\n",
      "from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of\n",
      "parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones\n",
      "of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,\n",
      "pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without\n",
      "first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had\n",
      "lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without\n",
      "first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge,\n",
      "motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When\n",
      "he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker\n",
      "looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the\n",
      "unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at\n",
      "it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then\n",
      "the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The\n",
      "look and the action had occupied but an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is a visitor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his\n",
      "work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said Defarge. “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when\n",
      "he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s\n",
      "information?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a lady’s shoe. It is a young lady’s walking-shoe. It is in the\n",
      "present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.” He\n",
      "glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the maker’s name?” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand\n",
      "in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the\n",
      "hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and\n",
      "so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission. The task of\n",
      "recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he\n",
      "had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or\n",
      "endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a\n",
      "fast-dying man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you ask me for my name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Assuredly I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all?”\n",

      "\n",

      "in his hand, for his shoemaker’s knife. It lay on that side of him\n",
      "which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was\n",

      "raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,\n",

      "\n",
      "He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began\n",

      "the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed\n",
      "aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and\n",
      "little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action\n",
      "he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his\n",
      "shoemaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his\n",
      "shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to\n",
      "be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand\n",
      "to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag\n",
      "attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained\n",
      "a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden\n",
      "hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. “It is\n",
      "the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to\n",
      "become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the\n",
      "light, and looked at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned\n",
      "out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was\n",

      "leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they\n",
      "may in the spirit.’ Those were the words I said. I remember them very\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.\n",
      "But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,\n",
      "though slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How was this?--_Was it you_?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a\n",
      "frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only\n",
      "said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near\n",
      "us, do not speak, do not move!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hark!” he exclaimed. “Whose voice was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white\n",
      "hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his\n",
      "shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and\n",
      "tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and\n",
      "gloomily shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can’t be. See what the\n",
      "prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face\n",
      "she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He\n",

      "name, my gentle angel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees\n",
      "before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,\n",

      "cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may\n",
      "tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless\n",
      "me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!”\n",
      "\n",
      "His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and\n",
      "lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you hear in my voice--I don’t know that it is so, but I hope it\n",
      "is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was\n",
      "sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in\n",
      "touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your\n",
      "breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when\n",
      "I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you\n",

      "“If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I\n",
      "have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at\n",
      "peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,\n",
      "and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And\n",
      "if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,\n",

      "touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which\n",
      "had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving\n",
      "breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all\n",
      "storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm\n",
      "called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and\n",
      "daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay\n",
      "there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his\n",
      "head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained\n",
      "him from the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as\n",
      "he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could be\n",
      "arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he\n",
      "could be taken away--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?” asked Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is true,” said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. “More\n",
      "than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.\n",
      "Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his\n",
      "methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then be so kind,” urged Miss Manette, “as to leave us here. You see how\n",
      "composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me\n",
      "now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from\n",
      "interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,\n",
      "as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until\n",
      "you return, and then we will remove him straight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and\n",
      "in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage\n",
      "and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,\n",
      "for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily\n",
      "dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away\n",
      "to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the\n",
      "hard ground close at the father’s side, and watched him. The darkness\n",
      "deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed\n",
      "through the chinks in the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and\n",
      "had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and\n",
      "meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the\n",
      "lamp he carried, on the shoemaker’s bench (there was nothing else in the\n",
      "garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and\n",
      "assisted him to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in\n",
      "the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened,\n",
      "whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that\n",
      "he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They\n",
      "tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to\n",
      "answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for\n",
      "the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of\n",
      "occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen\n",
      "in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his\n",
      "daughter’s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he\n",
      "ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak\n",
      "and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to\n",
      "his daughter’s drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand\n",
      "in both his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps\n",
      "of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and\n",
      "round at the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if\n",

      "\n",
      "“Remember? No, I don’t remember. It was so very long ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his\n",
      "prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,\n",
      "“One Hundred and Five, North Tower;” and when he looked about him, it\n",
      "evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed\n",
      "him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his\n",
      "tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was\n",
      "no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he\n",
      "dropped his daughter’s hand and clasped his head again.\n",
      "\n",
      "No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the\n",
      "many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural\n",
      "silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and\n",
      "that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and\n",
      "saw nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed\n",
      "him, when Mr. Lorry’s feet were arrested on the step by his asking,\n",
      "miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame\n",
      "Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and\n",
      "went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly\n",
      "brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned\n",
      "against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word “To the Barrier!” The\n",
      "postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble\n",
      "over-swinging lamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better\n",
      "streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,\n",
      "illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city\n",
      "gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. “Your papers,\n",
      "travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge,\n",
      "getting down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of\n",
      "monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with\n",
      "him, at the--” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the\n",
      "military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm\n",
      "in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day\n",
      "or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. “It is well.\n",
      "Forward!” from the uniform. “Adieu!” from Defarge. And so, under a short\n",

      "proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,\n",
      "proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence\n",

      "counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the\n",
      "wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of\n",
      "windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,\n",
      "and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the\n",
      "heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing\n",
      "“the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,\n",
      "where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its\n",
      "hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal\n",
      "twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden\n",
      "drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when\n",
      "they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they\n",
      "were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among\n",
      "the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good\n",
      "polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms\n",
      "made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their\n",
      "parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family\n",
      "papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great\n",
      "dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year\n",
      "one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you\n",
      "by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released\n",
      "from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads\n",
      "exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of\n",
      "Abyssinia or Ashantee.\n",
      "\n",
      "But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue\n",
      "with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s.\n",
      "Death is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s?\n",
      "Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note\n",
      "was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the\n",
      "purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder\n",
      "of a horse at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to\n",
      "Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of\n",
      "three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to\n",
      "Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it\n",
      "might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the\n",
      "reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each\n",
      "particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked\n",
      "after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day, like greater places of business,\n",
      "its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid\n",
      "low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately\n",
      "disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the\n",
      "ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson’s, the\n",
      "oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young\n",
      "man into Tellson’s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was\n",
      "old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full\n",
      "Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to\n",
      "be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches\n",
      "and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside Tellson’s--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an\n",
      "odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live\n",
      "sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless\n",
      "upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin\n",
      "of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson’s,\n",
      "in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always\n",
      "tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted\n",
      "this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful\n",
      "occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the\n",
      "easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added\n",

      "Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March\n",
      "morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself\n",
      "always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under\n",

      "Mr. Cruncher’s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were\n",
      "but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it\n",
      "might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as\n",
      "it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was\n",
      "already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged\n",
      "for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth\n",
      "was spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin\n",
      "at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll\n",
      "and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair\n",
      "looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he\n",

      "\n",
      "After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at\n",
      "the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the\n",
      "odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher’s domestic economy, that,\n",
      "whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he\n",
      "often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.\n",

      "\n",
      "Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning\n",

      "“And what do you suppose, you conceited female,” said Mr. Cruncher, with\n",

      "afford it. I’m not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If\n",
      "you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and\n",

      "then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I\n",
      "tell you,” here he addressed his wife once more, “I won’t be gone agin,\n",
      "in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I’m as sleepy as\n",
      "laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn’t know, if\n",
      "it wasn’t for the pain in ’em, which was me and which somebody else, yet\n",

      "from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook\n",
      "himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.\n",
      "In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,\n",
      "and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father’s did,\n",
      "kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor\n",
      "woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made\n",
      "his toilet, with a suppressed cry of “You are going to flop, mother.\n",

      "he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation\n",
      "of the day.\n",

      "It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite\n",

      "from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man’s\n",
      "feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr.\n",

      "standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to\n",
      "inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing\n",
      "boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,\n",
      "extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic\n",
      "in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two\n",
      "eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.\n",
      "The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that\n",
      "the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the\n",

      "in Fleet-street.\n",
      "\n",
      "The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson’s\n",

      "A Sight\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of\n",
      "clerks to Jerry the messenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. “I _do_\n",
      "know the Bailey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much\n",
      "better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment\n",
      "in question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the\n",
      "door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Into the court, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Into the court.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher’s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to\n",
      "interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that\n",
      "conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.\n",
      "Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,\n",
      "to remain there until he wants you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him\n",
      "you are there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the\n",
      "blotting-paper stage, remarked:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose they’ll be trying Forgeries this morning?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Treason!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s quartering,” said Jerry. “Barbarous!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised\n",
      "spectacles upon him. “It is the law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It’s hard enough to kill\n",
      "him, but it’s wery hard to spile him, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk. “Speak well of the law. Take\n",
      "care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take\n",
      "care of itself. I give you that advice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry. “I\n",
      "leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of\n",
      "gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry\n",
      "ways. Here is the letter. Go along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal\n",
      "deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one,\n",
      "too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,\n",
      "and went his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had\n",
      "not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.\n",
      "But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and\n",
      "villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came\n",
      "into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the\n",
      "dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It\n",
      "had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced\n",
      "his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died before him.\n",
      "For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,\n",
      "from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on\n",
      "a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a\n",
      "half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.\n",
      "So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It\n",
      "was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted\n",
      "a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for\n",
      "the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and\n",
      "softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in\n",
      "blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically\n",
      "leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed\n",
      "under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice\n",
      "illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism\n",
      "that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome\n",
      "consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this\n",
      "hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his\n",
      "way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in\n",
      "his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play\n",
      "at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the\n",
      "former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey\n",
      "doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the\n",
      "criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a\n",
      "very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into\n",
      "court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next\n",
      "to.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s coming on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Treason case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The quartering one, eh?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he’ll be drawn on a hurdle to\n",
      "be half hanged, and then he’ll be taken down and sliced before his own\n",
      "face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,\n",
      "and then his head will be chopped off, and he’ll be cut into quarters.\n",
      "That’s the sentence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he’s found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of proviso.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! they’ll find him guilty,” said the other. “Don’t you be afraid of\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the\n",
      "ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled\n",
      "at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round\n",
      "pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows\n",
      "stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,\n",
      "laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help\n",
      "themselves, at anybody’s cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got\n",
      "upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.\n",

      "of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a\n",
      "whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with\n",
      "the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,\n",
      "that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him\n",
      "in an impure mist and rain.\n",

      "The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about\n",
      "five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and\n",
      "a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly\n",
      "dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and\n",
      "dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out\n",
      "of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express\n",
      "itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his\n",
      "situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the\n",
      "soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,\n",
      "bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,\n",

      "horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage\n",
      "details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his\n",
      "fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,\n",
      "was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered\n",
      "and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various\n",

      "them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which\n",
      "claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the\n",
      "public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or\n",
      "even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the\n",
      "prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and\n",
      "repassing between France and England, on secret business of which\n",
      "he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of\n",
      "traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real\n",
      "wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.\n",
      "That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who\n",
      "was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the\n",
      "prisoner’s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his\n",
      "Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.\n",
      "That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and\n",
      "attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner’s\n",
      "friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his\n",
      "infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish\n",
      "in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues\n",
      "were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public\n",
      "benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as\n",
      "they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,\n",

      "whereat the jury’s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that\n",
      "they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more\n",
      "especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.\n",
      "That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness\n",
      "for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had\n",
      "communicated itself to the prisoner’s servant, and had engendered in him\n",
      "a holy determination to examine his master’s table-drawers and pockets,\n",
      "and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to\n",
      "hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,\n",
      "in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General’s)\n",
      "brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.\n",
      "Attorney-General’s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence\n",
      "on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two\n",
      "witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be\n",
      "produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of\n",
      "his Majesty’s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by\n",
      "sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed\n",
      "such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be\n",
      "proved to be in the prisoner’s handwriting; but that it was all the\n",
      "same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as\n",
      "showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof\n",
      "would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged\n",
      "in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the\n",
      "very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.\n",
      "That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they\n",

      "positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether\n",
      "they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their\n",

      "their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion\n",
      "of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that\n",
      "there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon\n",
      "pillows at all, unless the prisoner’s head was taken off. That head\n",
      "Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of\n",

      "of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the\n",

      "Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very\n",
      "distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors’\n",
      "prison? Didn’t see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors’\n",
      "prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three\n",
      "times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever\n",
      "been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs?\n",
      "Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell\n",
      "downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at\n",
      "dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who\n",
      "committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?\n",
      "Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not\n",
      "more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.\n",
      "Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a\n",
      "very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?\n",
      "No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more\n",
      "about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No.\n",
      "Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government\n",
      "pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear\n",

      "his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the\n",
      "prisoner’s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from\n",
      "the drawer of the prisoner’s desk. He had not put them there first. He\n",
      "had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen\n",
      "at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and\n",
      "Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given\n",
      "information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;\n",
      "he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be\n",
      "only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;\n",
      "that was merely a coincidence. He didn’t call it a particularly curious\n",
      "coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a\n",

      "traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest\n",
      "scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look\n",
      "rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,\n",

      "gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman\n",
      "and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that\n",
      "reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and\n",
      "impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.\n",

      "character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the\n",
      "State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed\n",

      "Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the\n",
      "prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning\n",
      "the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole\n",
      "decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.\n",
      "\n",

      "whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced\n",
      "anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and\n",
      "grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,\n",
      "and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion\n",
      "in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man\n",
      "sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put\n",
      "on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his\n",
      "hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all\n",
      "day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him\n",
      "a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he\n",
      "undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,\n",
      "when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the\n",
      "lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would\n",
      "hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the\n",
      "observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I’d hold half a guinea\n",

      "\n",
      "Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he\n",

      "her father’s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:\n",

      "him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown\n",
      "strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or\n",
      "brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,\n",
      "ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a\n",
      "moment, spoke, through their foreman.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George\n",
      "Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,\n",
      "but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,\n",
      "and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in\n",
      "the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the\n",
      "jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get\n",

      "the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial\n",
      "influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could\n",
      "recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few\n",
      "and slight, and she believed them over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned\n",
      "to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little\n",
      "more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,\n",
      "loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing\n",
      "way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and\n",
      "conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his\n",
      "late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean\n",
      "out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the\n",
      "less likely to succeed on that account.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,”\n",
      " said his late client, taking his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as\n",
      "another man’s, I believe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry\n",
      "said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested\n",
      "object of squeezing himself back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think so?” said Mr. Stryver. “Well! you have been present all day,\n",
      "and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had\n",
      "now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered\n",
      "him out of it--“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up\n",
      "this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver; “I have a night’s work to\n",
      "do yet. Speak for yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and for\n",
      "Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?”\n",
      " He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at\n",
      "Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,\n",
      "not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his\n",
      "thoughts had wandered away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.\n",
      "\n",
      "He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall we go home, my father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the\n",
      "impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be\n",
      "released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the\n",
      "passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,\n",
      "and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning’s interest of\n",
      "gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.\n",
      "Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into\n",
      "the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter\n",
      "departed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back\n",
      "to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or\n",
      "interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning\n",
      "against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled\n",
      "out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now\n",
      "stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton’s part in the day’s\n",
      "proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the\n",
      "better for it in appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the\n",
      "business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business\n",
      "appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that before,\n",
      "sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We\n",
      "have to think of the House more than ourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ know, _I_ know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. “Don’t be\n",
      "nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,\n",
      "I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really don’t\n",
      "know what you have to do with the matter. If you’ll excuse me, as very\n",
      "much your elder, for saying so, I really don’t know that it is your\n",

      "\n",
      "“Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business,” said Mr. Carton.\n",

      "“Lord love you, no!--I shouldn’t,” said Mr. Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,\n",
      "“business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,\n",
      "if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance\n",
      "for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!\n",
      "I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy\n",
      "life.--Chair there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson’s. Carton,\n",
      "who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed\n",
      "then, and turned to Darnay:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must\n",

      "some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to\n",
      "Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were\n",
      "shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting\n",
      "his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat\n",
      "opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port\n",
      "before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far\n",
      "mended as to feel that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must be an immense satisfaction!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.\n",
      "It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we\n",
      "are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are\n",
      "not much alike in any particular, you and I.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with\n",
      "this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was\n",
      "at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now your dinner is done,” Carton presently said, “why don’t you call a\n",

      "\n",
      "“What health? What toast?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, it’s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I’ll\n",

      "pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!”\n",
      " he said, filling his new goblet.\n",
      "\n",
      "A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it\n",
      "feel? Is it worth being tried for one’s life, to be the object of such\n",
      "sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Darnay answered not a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not\n",
      "that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this\n",
      "disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the\n",
      "strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him\n",
      "for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder.\n",
      "“It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don’t know why I did\n",
      "it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think I particularly like you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, Mr. Carton,” returned the other, oddly disconcerted, “I have\n",

      "\n",
      "“But ask yourself the question now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have acted as if you do; but I don’t think you do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t think I do,” said Carton. “I begin to have a very good\n",
      "opinion of your understanding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nevertheless,” pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, “there is\n",
      "nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our\n",
      "parting without ill-blood on either side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton rejoining, “Nothing in life!” Darnay rang. “Do you call the whole\n",

      "ten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.\n",
      "Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat\n",
      "of defiance in his manner, and said, “A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think\n",
      "I am drunk?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I\n",
      "care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don’t let your sober face elate you,\n",

      "When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a\n",
      "glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you particularly like the man?” he muttered, at his own image; “why\n",
      "should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing\n",
      "in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have\n",
      "made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you\n",
      "what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change\n",
      "places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as\n",
      "he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and\n",
      "have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few\n",

      "in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a\n",
      "perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.\n",
      "The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other\n",

      "among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib\n",
      "man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that\n",
      "faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is\n",
      "among the most striking and necessary of the advocate’s accomplishments.\n",
      "But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more\n",
      "business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its\n",
      "pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney\n",
      "Carton, he always had his points at his fingers’ ends in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver’s great\n",

      "might have floated a king’s ship. Stryver never had a case in hand,\n",
      "anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring\n",
      "at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there\n",
      "they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was\n",
      "rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily\n",
      "to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about,\n",

      "or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them\n",
      "out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down\n",
      "at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”\n",

      "matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on\n",
      "him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the\n",
      "jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as\n",
      "no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious\n",
      "gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and\n",
      "proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,\n",
      "made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal\n",
      "assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his\n",
      "hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then\n",
      "invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application\n",
      "to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;\n",
      "this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not\n",
      "disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr.\n",
      "Stryver.\n",
      "\n",
      "The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming\n",
      "again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses\n",

      "\n",
      "“I always am sound; am I not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to\n",
      "it and smooth it again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver, nodding\n",
      "his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the\n",
      "old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and\n",
      "now in despondency!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! The same Sydney, with the same\n",
      "luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God knows. It was my way, I suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before\n",
      "him, looking at the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,\n",
      "as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour\n",
      "was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney\n",
      "Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way\n",
      "is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look\n",
      "at me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more\n",
      "good-humoured laugh, “don’t _you_ be moral!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do what I\n",
      "do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it’s not worth\n",
      "your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to\n",
      "do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.”\n",

      "“I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,” said\n",
      "Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,”\n",
      " pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into\n",
      "mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,\n",
      "picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we\n",
      "didn’t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always\n",
      "nowhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And whose fault was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always\n",
      "driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree\n",
      "that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It’s a gloomy\n",
      "thing, however, to talk about one’s own past, with the day breaking.\n",
      "Turn me in some other direction before I go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding up\n",
      "his glass. “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass. “I have had\n",

      "\n",
      "“Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge\n",
      "of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,\n",
      "and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather\n",
      "thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,\n",
      "and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a\n",
      "yard or two of a man’s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.\n",

      "When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light\n",
      "him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy\n",
      "windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the\n",
      "dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a\n",
      "lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round\n",
      "before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and\n",
      "the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still\n",
      "on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the\n",
      "wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and\n",
      "perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries\n",
      "from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the\n",
      "fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.\n",
      "A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of\n",
      "houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its\n",
      "pillow was wet with wasted tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of\n",
      "good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,\n",
      "incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight\n",

      "The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not\n",
      "far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the\n",
      "waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried\n",
      "it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis\n",
      "Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,\n",
      "on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into\n",
      "business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor’s friend, and the\n",
      "quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in\n",
      "the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine\n",
      "Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;\n",
      "secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with\n",
      "them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and\n",
      "generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have\n",
      "his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the\n",
      "Doctor’s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be\n",
      "found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of\n",
      "the Doctor’s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that\n",
      "had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,\n",
      "north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers\n",
      "grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a\n",
      "consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,\n",
      "instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a\n",
      "settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which\n",
      "the peaches ripened in their season.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part\n",
      "of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,\n",
      "though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a\n",
      "glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful\n",
      "place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and\n",
      "there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where\n",
      "several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was\n",
      "audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In\n",
      "a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree\n",
      "rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver\n",
      "to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant\n",
      "who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if\n",
      "he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all\n",
      "visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured\n",
      "to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have\n",
      "a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray\n",
      "workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered\n",
      "about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a\n",
      "thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions\n",
      "required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind\n",
      "the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way\n",
      "from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and\n",
      "its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.\n",
      "His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting\n",
      "ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and\n",
      "he earned as much as he wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry’s knowledge, thoughts, and\n",
      "notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,\n",
      "on the fine Sunday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doctor Manette at home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Lucie at home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Pross at home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to\n",
      "anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the\n",
      "fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I’ll go upstairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Doctor’s daughter had known nothing of the country of her\n",
      "birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to\n",
      "make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most\n",
      "agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off\n",
      "by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,\n",
      "that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the\n",
      "rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,\n",
      "the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by\n",
      "delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in\n",
      "themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry\n",
      "stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,\n",
      "with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this\n",
      "time, whether he approved?\n",
      "\n",
      "There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they\n",
      "communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them\n",
      "all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which\n",
      "he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was\n",
      "the best room, and in it were Lucie’s birds, and flowers, and books,\n",
      "and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was\n",
      "the Doctor’s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,\n",
      "changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the\n",
      "Doctor’s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker’s\n",
      "bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the\n",
      "dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he keeps\n",
      "that reminder of his sufferings about him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.\n",
      "\n",
      "It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose\n",
      "acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and\n",
      "had since improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have thought--” Mr. Lorry began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pooh! You’d have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you do?” inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to\n",
      "express that she bore him no malice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; “how\n",
      "are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! indeed!” said Miss Pross. “I am very much put out about my\n",
      "Ladybird.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For gracious sake say something else besides ‘indeed,’ or you’ll\n",
      "fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from\n",
      "stature) was shortness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better. Yes, I am\n",
      "very much put out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I ask the cause?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to\n",
      "come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hundreds,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her\n",
      "time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,\n",
      "she exaggerated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and\n",
      "paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take\n",
      "your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her\n",
      "for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it’s really very hard,”\n",
      " said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;\n",
      "using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would\n",
      "fit anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,\n",
      "are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. “When you began it--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ began it, Miss Pross?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Didn’t you? Who brought her father to life?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard\n",
      "enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except\n",
      "that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on\n",
      "him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any\n",
      "circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds\n",
      "and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven\n",
      "him), to take Ladybird’s affections away from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by\n",
      "this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those\n",
      "unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and\n",
      "admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost\n",
      "it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were\n",
      "never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon\n",
      "their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there\n",
      "is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so\n",
      "rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted\n",
      "respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own\n",
      "mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss\n",
      "Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably\n",
      "better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,” said\n",
      "Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn’t made a\n",
      "mistake in life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here again: Mr. Lorry’s inquiries into Miss Pross’s personal history had\n",
      "established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel\n",
      "who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to\n",
      "speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with\n",
      "no touch of compunction. Miss Pross’s fidelity of belief in Solomon\n",
      "(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious\n",
      "matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of\n",
      "business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had\n",
      "sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you--does the Doctor,\n",
      "in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. “But I don’t say he don’t\n",
      "refer to it within himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Do you imagine--” Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up\n",
      "short with:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,\n",
      "sometimes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now and then,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his\n",
      "bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has any\n",
      "theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to\n",
      "the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his\n",

      "“I don’t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that is--?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That she thinks he has.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now don’t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a\n",
      "mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No, no,\n",
      "no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor\n",
      "Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured\n",
      "he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,\n",
      "though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now\n",
      "intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly\n",
      "attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss\n",
      "Pross, I don’t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of\n",
      "zealous interest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad’s the best, you’ll tell\n",
      "me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid\n",
      "of the whole subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Afraid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It’s a dreadful\n",
      "remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not\n",
      "knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never\n",
      "feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn’t make the\n",
      "subject pleasant, I should think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. “True,” said\n",
      "he, “and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss\n",
      "Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression\n",
      "always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness\n",
      "it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head. “Touch that\n",
      "string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.\n",
      "In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in\n",
      "the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking\n",
      "up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to\n",
      "know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in\n",
      "his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up\n",
      "and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says\n",
      "a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it\n",
      "best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down\n",
      "together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have\n",
      "brought him to himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding Miss Pross’s denial of her own imagination, there was a\n",
      "perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,\n",
      "in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to\n",
      "her possessing such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it\n",
      "had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it\n",
      "seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had\n",
      "set it going.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;\n",
      "“and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a\n",
      "peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,\n",
      "looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied\n",
      "they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though\n",
      "the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be\n",
      "heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close\n",
      "at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross\n",
      "was ready at the street door to receive them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking\n",
      "off her darling’s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up\n",
      "with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and\n",
      "folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with\n",
      "as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she\n",
      "had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant\n",
      "sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against\n",
      "her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do\n",
      "playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own\n",
      "chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at\n",
      "them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with\n",
      "eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would\n",
      "have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,\n",
      "beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor\n",
      "stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no\n",
      "Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain\n",
      "for the fulfilment of Miss Pross’s prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of\n",
      "the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and\n",
      "always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest\n",
      "quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their\n",
      "contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be\n",
      "better. Miss Pross’s friendship being of the thoroughly practical\n",
      "kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of\n",
      "impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would\n",
      "impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters\n",
      "of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl\n",
      "who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,\n",
      "or Cinderella’s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,\n",
      "a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she\n",
      "pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor’s table, but on other days\n",
      "persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower\n",
      "regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to\n",
      "which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,\n",
      "Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird’s pleasant face and pleasant efforts\n",
      "to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the\n",
      "wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit\n",
      "there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,\n",
      "they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for\n",
      "the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some\n",
      "time before, as Mr. Lorry’s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the\n",
      "plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs\n",
      "and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree\n",
      "whispered to them in its own way above their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay\n",
      "presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he\n",
      "was only One.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross\n",
      "suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and\n",
      "retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this\n",
      "disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the\n",
      "jerks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The\n",
      "resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as\n",
      "they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting\n",
      "his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the\n",
      "likeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual\n",
      "vivacity. “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the\n",
      "plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,\n",
      "which happened to be the old buildings of London--“have you seen much of\n",
      "the Tower?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of\n",
      "it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile,\n",
      "though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a\n",
      "character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a\n",
      "curious thing when I was there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that?” Lucie asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which\n",
      "had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of\n",
      "its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by\n",
      "prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone\n",
      "in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to\n",
      "execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with\n",
      "some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.\n",
      "At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully\n",
      "examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or\n",
      "legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses\n",
      "were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested\n",
      "that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The\n",
      "floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the\n",
      "earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found\n",
      "the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case\n",
      "or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he\n",
      "had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and\n",
      "his look quite terrified them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they\n",
      "made me start. We had better go in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large\n",
      "drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he\n",
      "said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told\n",
      "of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry\n",
      "either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned\n",
      "towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it\n",
      "when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of\n",
      "his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more\n",
      "steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he\n",
      "was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and\n",
      "that the rain had startled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon\n",
      "her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he\n",
      "made only Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and\n",
      "windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was\n",
      "done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the\n",
      "heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton\n",
      "leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of\n",
      "the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the\n",
      "ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor\n",
      "Manette. “It comes slowly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It comes surely,” said Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a\n",
      "dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to\n",
      "get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes\n",
      "resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a\n",
      "footstep was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they had\n",
      "listened for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie. “Sometimes, I have\n",
      "sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of\n",
      "a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and\n",
      "solemn--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we\n",
      "originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have\n",
      "sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made\n",
      "the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming\n",
      "by-and-bye into our lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”\n",
      " Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more\n",
      "rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,\n",
      "as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some\n",
      "coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in\n",
      "the distant streets, and not one within sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or\n",
      "are we to divide them among us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you\n",
      "asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and\n",
      "then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come\n",
      "into my life, and my father’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I take them into mine!” said Carton. “_I_ ask no questions and make no\n",
      "stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,\n",
      "and I see them--by the Lightning.” He added the last words, after there\n",
      "had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder. “Here they\n",
      "come, fast, fierce, and furious!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,\n",
      "for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and\n",
      "lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment’s\n",
      "interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at\n",
      "midnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great bell of Saint Paul’s was striking one in the cleared air, when\n",
      "Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set\n",
      "forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches\n",
      "of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful\n",
      "of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was\n",
      "usually performed a good two hours earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry, “to\n",
      "bring the dead out of their graves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don’t expect to--what\n",

      "\n",
      "“Good night, Mr. Carton,” said the man of business. “Good night, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!”\n",

      "CHAPTER VII.\n",
      "Monseigneur in Town\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his\n",
      "fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in\n",
      "his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to\n",
      "the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur\n",
      "was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many\n",
      "things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather\n",
      "rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning’s chocolate could not so\n",
      "much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four\n",
      "strong men besides the Cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the\n",
      "Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his\n",
      "pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to\n",
      "conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur’s lips. One lacquey carried\n",
      "the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed\n",
      "the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;\n",
      "a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold\n",
      "watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to\n",
      "dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high\n",
      "place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon\n",
      "his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three\n",
      "men; he must have died of two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy\n",
      "and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at\n",
      "a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so\n",
      "impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far\n",
      "more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and\n",
      "state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance\n",
      "for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly\n",
      "favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted\n",
      "days of the merry Stuart who sold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which\n",
      "was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public\n",
      "business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go\n",
      "his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and\n",
      "particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world\n",
      "was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original\n",
      "by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness\n",
      "thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into\n",
      "his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of\n",
      "affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances\n",
      "public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and\n",
      "must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances\n",
      "private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after\n",
      "generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence\n",
      "Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet\n",
      "time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could\n",
      "wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,\n",
      "poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with\n",
      "a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer\n",
      "rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior\n",
      "mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked\n",
      "down upon him with the loftiest contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his\n",
      "stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women\n",
      "waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and\n",
      "forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial\n",
      "relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality\n",
      "among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with\n",
      "every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could\n",

      "no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies\n",
      "for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly\n",
      "patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had\n",
      "discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the\n",
      "State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to\n",
      "root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears\n",
      "they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving\n",
      "Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making\n",
      "card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving\n",

      "since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural\n",

      "exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various\n",
      "notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies\n",
      "among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half\n",
      "of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among\n",
      "the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and\n",
      "appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of\n",
      "bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far\n",
      "towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing\n",
      "known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,\n",
      "and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and\n",
      "supped as at twenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance\n",
      "upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional\n",
      "people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that\n",
      "things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting\n",
      "them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic\n",
      "sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves\n",
      "whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the\n",
      "spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the\n",
      "Future, for Monseigneur’s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other\n",
      "three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a\n",
      "jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the\n",
      "Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got\n",
      "out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of\n",
      "the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,\n",
      "by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much\n",
      "discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never\n",
      "became manifest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of\n",
      "Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been\n",
      "ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally\n",
      "correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such\n",
      "delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant\n",
      "swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would\n",
      "surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen\n",
      "of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they\n",
      "languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;\n",
      "and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and\n",
      "fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and\n",
      "his devouring hunger far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all\n",
      "things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that\n",
      "was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through\n",
      "Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals\n",
      "of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball\n",
      "descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was\n",
      "required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,\n",
      "and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a\n",
      "rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother\n",
      "Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call\n",
      "him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at\n",
      "Monseigneur’s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year\n",
      "of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled\n",
      "hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would\n",
      "see the very stars out!\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his\n",
      "chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown\n",
      "open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and\n",
      "fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in\n",
      "body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have\n",
      "been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never\n",
      "troubled it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one\n",
      "happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably\n",
      "passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of\n",
      "Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due\n",
      "course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate\n",
      "sprites, and was seen no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,\n",
      "and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon\n",
      "but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm\n",
      "and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his\n",
      "way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,\n",
      "and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the\n",
      "dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and\n",
      "with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every\n",
      "feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,\n",
      "beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top\n",
      "of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little\n",
      "change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing\n",
      "colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted\n",
      "by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of\n",
      "treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with\n",
      "attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the\n",
      "line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much\n",
      "too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a\n",
      "handsome face, and a remarkable one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and\n",
      "drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had\n",
      "stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer\n",
      "in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable\n",
      "to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and\n",
      "often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were\n",
      "charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no\n",
      "check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had\n",
      "sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,\n",
      "that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician\n",
      "custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a\n",
      "barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second\n",
      "time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were\n",
      "left to get out of their difficulties as they could.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of\n",
      "consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage\n",
      "dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming\n",
      "before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of\n",
      "its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its\n",
      "wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a\n",
      "number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have\n",
      "stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded\n",
      "behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,\n",
      "and there were twenty hands at the horses’ bridles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of\n",
      "the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was\n",
      "down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is\n",
      "a child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,\n",
      "into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly\n",
      "got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the\n",
      "Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at\n",
      "their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was\n",
      "nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness\n",
      "and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the\n",
      "people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they\n",
      "remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat\n",
      "and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes\n",
      "over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took out his purse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take care\n",
      "of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in\n",
      "the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give\n",
      "him that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads\n",
      "craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The\n",
      "tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest\n",
      "made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,\n",
      "sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were\n",
      "stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They\n",
      "were as silent, however, as the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know all, I know all,” said the last comer. “Be a brave man, my\n",
      "Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to\n",
      "live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour\n",
      "as happily?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a philosopher, you there,” said the Marquis, smiling. “How do\n",
      "they call you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They call me Defarge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of what trade?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the Marquis,\n",
      "throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will. The horses\n",
      "there; are they right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the\n",
      "Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the\n",
      "air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had\n",
      "paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly\n",
      "disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis. “Hold the horses! Who threw that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a\n",
      "moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on\n",
      "the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the\n",
      "figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,\n",
      "except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over any of you very\n",
      "willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal\n",
      "threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he\n",
      "should be crushed under the wheels.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of\n",
      "what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not\n",
      "a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.\n",
      "But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the\n",
      "Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his\n",
      "contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he\n",
      "leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick\n",
      "succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the\n",
      "Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the\n",
      "whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats\n",
      "had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking\n",
      "on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the\n",
      "spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through\n",
      "which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and\n",
      "bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle\n",
      "while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running\n",
      "of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who\n",
      "had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness\n",
      "of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran\n",
      "into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,\n",
      "time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together\n",
      "in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all\n",

      "A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.\n",
      "Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas\n",
      "and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On\n",
      "inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent\n",
      "tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected\n",
      "disposition to give up, and wither away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been\n",
      "lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up\n",
      "a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was\n",
      "no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was\n",
      "occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting\n",
      "sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it\n",
      "gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. “It will\n",
      "die out,” said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, “directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the\n",
      "heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down\n",
      "hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed\n",
      "quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow\n",
      "left when the drag was taken off.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village\n",
      "at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a\n",
      "church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a\n",
      "fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects\n",
      "as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was\n",
      "coming near home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor\n",
      "tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor\n",
      "fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All\n",
      "its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,\n",
      "shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the\n",
      "fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of\n",
      "the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,\n",
      "were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax\n",
      "for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be\n",
      "paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until\n",
      "the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,\n",
      "their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest\n",
      "terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;\n",
      "or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions’\n",
      "whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as\n",
      "if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in\n",
      "his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the\n",
      "fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.\n",
      "He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow\n",
      "sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the\n",
      "meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the\n",
      "truth through the best part of a hundred years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,\n",
      "with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of\n",
      "staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony\n",
      "business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and\n",
      "stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in\n",
      "all directions. As if the Gorgon’s head had surveyed it, when it was\n",
      "finished, two centuries ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau\n",
      "preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness\n",
      "to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile\n",
      "of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the\n",
      "flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great\n",
      "door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being\n",
      "in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl’s voice there was none,\n",
      "save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of\n",
      "those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then\n",
      "heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a\n",
      "hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;\n",
      "grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a\n",
      "peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord\n",
      "was angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,\n",
      "Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up\n",
      "the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him\n",
      "to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two\n",
      "others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon\n",
      "the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries\n",
      "befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.\n",
      "The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to\n",
      "break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;\n",
      "but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old\n",
      "pages in the history of France.\n",
      "\n",
      "A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round\n",
      "room, in one of the chateau’s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small\n",
      "lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds\n",
      "closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of\n",
      "black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; “they\n",
      "said he was not arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the\n",
      "table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his\n",
      "sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and\n",
      "he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his\n",
      "lips, when he put it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the\n",
      "horizontal lines of black and stone colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur? That?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are\n",
      "here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into\n",
      "the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round\n",
      "for instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good,” said the imperturbable master. “Close them again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was\n",
      "half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,\n",
      "hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the\n",
      "front of the chateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ask who is arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind\n",
      "Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance\n",
      "rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.\n",
      "He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and\n",
      "there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.\n",
      "He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his\n",
      "seat at table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yesterday. And you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I come direct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From London?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary; I come direct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time\n",
      "intending the journey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been detained by”--the nephew stopped a moment in his\n",
      "answer--“various business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without doubt,” said the polished uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.\n",
      "When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,\n",
      "looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a\n",
      "fine mask, opened a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that\n",
      "took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is\n",
      "a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have\n",
      "sustained me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me to\n",
      "the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight\n",
      "lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a\n",
      "graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good\n",
      "breeding that it was not reassuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may have\n",
      "expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious\n",
      "circumstances that surrounded me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with\n",
      "deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,\n",
      "and would know no scruple as to means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the\n",
      "two marks. “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I recall it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical\n",
      "instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your\n",
      "bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in\n",
      "France here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.\n",
      "“Dare I ask you to explain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not\n",
      "been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would\n",
      "have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. “For the honour\n",
      "of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.\n",
      "Pray excuse me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before\n",
      "yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined\n",
      "politeness; “I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for\n",
      "consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence\n",
      "your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for\n",
      "yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,\n",
      "at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle\n",
      "aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that\n",
      "might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest\n",
      "and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted\n",
      "(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such\n",
      "things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right\n",
      "of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such\n",
      "dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),\n",
      "one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing\n",
      "some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have\n",
      "lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the\n",
      "assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as\n",
      "to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very\n",
      "bad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;\n",
      "as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still\n",
      "containing himself, that great means of regeneration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern\n",
      "time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name to be\n",
      "more detested than any name in France.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us hope so,” said the uncle. “Detestation of the high is the\n",
      "involuntary homage of the low.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can\n",
      "look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any\n",
      "deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family,\n",
      "merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.\n",
      "Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly\n",
      "crossed his legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes\n",
      "thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at\n",
      "him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,\n",
      "and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of\n",
      "indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear\n",
      "and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs\n",
      "obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts\n",
      "out the sky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the\n",
      "chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as\n",
      "they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to\n",
      "him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from\n",
      "the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof\n",
      "he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new\n",
      "way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead\n",
      "was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and repose\n",
      "of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we\n",
      "terminate our conference for the night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A moment more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An hour, if you please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits\n",
      "of wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_We_ have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,\n",
      "and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account\n",
      "to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father’s time, we did\n",
      "a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and\n",
      "our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father’s time,\n",
      "when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father’s twin-brother, joint\n",
      "inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Death has done that!” said the Marquis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is\n",
      "frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to\n",
      "execute the last request of my dear mother’s lips, and obey the last\n",
      "look of my dear mother’s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to\n",
      "redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching him on the\n",
      "breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you\n",
      "will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was\n",
      "cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking\n",
      "quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he\n",
      "touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of\n",
      "a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the\n",
      "body, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have\n",
      "lived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his\n",
      "box in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small\n",
      "bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,\n",
      "Monsieur Charles, I see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I\n",
      "renounce them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It\n",
      "is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed\n",
      "to me from you, to-morrow--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--or twenty years hence--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that\n",
      "supposition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to\n",
      "relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,\n",
      "under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,\n",
      "mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,\n",
      "and suffering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better\n",
      "qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the\n",
      "weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave\n",
      "it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in\n",
      "another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse\n",
      "on it, and on all this land.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you?” said the uncle. “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new\n",
      "philosophy, graciously intend to live?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at\n",
      "their backs, may have to do some day--work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In England, for example?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The\n",
      "family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be\n",
      "lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The\n",
      "Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his\n",
      "valet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have\n",
      "prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew\n",
      "with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may\n",
      "be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You\n",
      "know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With a daughter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the Marquis. “You are fatigued. Good night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy\n",
      "in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,\n",
      "which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same\n",
      "time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin\n",
      "straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that\n",
      "looked handsomely diabolic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” repeated the Marquis. “A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So\n",
      "commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face\n",
      "outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew\n",
      "looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night!” said the uncle. “I look to the pleasure of seeing you\n",
      "again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his\n",
      "chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he\n",
      "added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his\n",
      "valet to his own bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his\n",
      "loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still\n",
      "night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no\n",
      "noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some\n",
      "enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose\n",
      "periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just\n",
      "coming on.\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the\n",
      "scraps of the day’s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow\n",
      "toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the\n",
      "prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at\n",
      "the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the\n",
      "chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,\n",
      "the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the\n",
      "tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin\n",
      "gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence\n",
      "with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night\n",
      "for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables\n",
      "rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with\n",
      "very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to\n",
      "the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures\n",
      "hardly ever to say what is set down for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,\n",
      "stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,\n",
      "dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.\n",
      "The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass\n",
      "were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might\n",
      "have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,\n",
      "taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as\n",
      "the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and\n",
      "the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and\n",
      "freed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain\n",
      "at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the\n",
      "minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark\n",
      "hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,\n",
      "and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still\n",
      "trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water\n",
      "of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces\n",
      "crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the\n",
      "weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur\n",
      "the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.\n",
      "At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open\n",
      "mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement\n",
      "windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth\n",
      "shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely\n",
      "lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the\n",
      "fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men\n",
      "and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows\n",
      "out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church\n",
      "and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter\n",
      "prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its\n",
      "foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and\n",
      "surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been\n",
      "reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;\n",
      "now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked\n",
      "round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at\n",
      "doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs\n",
      "pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the\n",
      "return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the\n",
      "chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried\n",
      "figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and\n",
      "everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?\n",
      "\n",
      "What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already\n",
      "at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day’s dinner (not\n",
      "much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow’s while to\n",
      "peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it\n",
      "to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or\n",
      "no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,\n",
      "down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the\n",
      "fountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about\n",
      "in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other\n",
      "emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought\n",
      "in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly\n",
      "on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their\n",
      "trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of\n",
      "the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and\n",
      "all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded\n",
      "on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was\n",
      "highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated\n",
      "into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting\n",
      "himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,\n",
      "and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind\n",
      "a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle\n",
      "(double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of\n",
      "the German ballad of Leonora?\n",
      "\n",
      "It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added\n",
      "the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited\n",
      "through about two hundred years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine\n",
      "mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the\n",
      "heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt\n",
      "was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:\n",

      "More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles\n",
      "Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French\n",
      "language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he\n",
      "would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with\n",
      "young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a\n",
      "living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for\n",
      "its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in\n",
      "sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not\n",
      "at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were\n",
      "to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had\n",
      "dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a\n",
      "tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and\n",
      "profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his\n",
      "work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became\n",
      "known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the\n",
      "circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.\n",
      "So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.\n",
      "\n",
      "In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor\n",
      "to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he\n",
      "would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and\n",
      "did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he\n",
      "read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a\n",
      "contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek\n",
      "and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in\n",
      "London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days\n",
      "when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has\n",
      "invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay’s way--the way of the love of a\n",
      "woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never\n",

      "confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for\n",

      "at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,\n",
      "long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the\n",
      "mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so\n",
      "much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a\n",
      "summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,\n",
      "he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity\n",
      "of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer\n",
      "day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy\n",
      "which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated\n",
      "their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a\n",
      "very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength\n",
      "of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was\n",
      "sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the\n",
      "exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been\n",
      "frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with\n",
      "ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at\n",
      "sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your\n",

      "laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,\n",

      "you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could\n",
      "hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that\n",
      "in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to\n",
      "you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your\n",

      "to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental\n",
      "debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as\n",
      "well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange\n",
      "at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two\n",
      "before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it\n",
      "and Hilary.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly\n",
      "saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly\n",
      "grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a\n",
      "plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the\n",
      "plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for\n",
      "the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to\n",

      "Stryver’s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness\n",
      "of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle\n",
      "in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient\n",
      "cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.\n",
      "Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron\n",

      "under the clouds were a sum.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was Stryver’s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any\n",
      "place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson’s, that old clerks\n",

      "of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson’s who shook\n",
      "hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a\n",

      "\n",
      "“My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course, friendly and\n",
      "appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,\n",
      "my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.\n",
      "Stryver--” Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest\n",

      "\n",

      "“Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?” demanded Stryver,\n",
      "perceptibly crestfallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! I--Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Straight!” said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I think I wouldn’t, if I was you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” said Stryver. “Now, I’ll put you in a corner,” forensically\n",
      "shaking a forefinger at him. “You are a man of business and bound to\n",
      "have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn’t you go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” said Mr. Lorry, “I wouldn’t go on such an object without\n",

      "\n",
      "“Here’s a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_\n",
      "a Bank,” said Stryver; “and having summed up three leading reasons for\n",
      "complete success, he says there’s no reason at all! Says it with his\n",
      "head on!” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have\n",
      "been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and\n",

      "young lady. The young lady goes before all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his\n",
      "elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at\n",
      "present in question is a mincing Fool?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,” said Mr. Lorry,\n",
      "reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady\n",
      "from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose\n",
      "taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could\n",
      "not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at\n",
      "this desk, not even Tellson’s should prevent my giving him a piece of my\n",
      "mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver’s\n",
      "blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;\n",

      "no better state now it was his turn.\n",
      "\n",

      "be no mistake about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood\n",
      "hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the\n",
      "toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not\n",
      "to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King’s Bench\n",

      "“Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And all I can say of it is,” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, “that\n",
      "this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry. “As a man of business, I am\n",
      "not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of\n",
      "business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried\n",
      "Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and\n",
      "of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have\n",
      "spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I\n",
      "may not be right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not I!” said Stryver, whistling. “I can’t undertake to find third\n",
      "parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense\n",
      "in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It’s\n",
      "new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And\n",
      "understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I\n",
      "will not--not even at Tellson’s--have it characterised for me by any\n",
      "gentleman breathing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! I beg your pardon!” said Stryver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be\n",
      "painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor\n",
      "Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very\n",
      "painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You\n",
      "know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with\n",
      "the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you\n",
      "in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a\n",
      "little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon\n",
      "it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its\n",
      "soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied\n",
      "with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is\n",
      "best spared. What do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long would you keep me in town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the\n",
      "evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won’t go up there now, I am not so\n",
      "hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look\n",
      "in to-night. Good morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a\n",
      "concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it\n",
      "bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength\n",
      "of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were\n",
      "always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly\n",
      "believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in\n",
      "the empty office until they bowed another customer in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have\n",
      "gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than\n",
      "moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to\n",
      "swallow, he got it down. “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\n",
      "forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my way\n",
      "out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found\n",
      "great relief. “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr.\n",
      "Stryver; “I’ll do that for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o’clock,\n",
      "Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the\n",
      "purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of\n",
      "the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was\n",
      "altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\n",
      "bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. “I have been to\n",
      "Soho.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. “Oh, to be sure! What am I\n",
      "thinking of!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the\n",
      "conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my\n",
      "advice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I\n",
      "am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father’s\n",
      "account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let\n",
      "us say no more about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand you,” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and\n",
      "final way; “no matter, no matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No it doesn’t; I assure you it doesn’t. Having supposed that there was\n",
      "sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is\n",
      "not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is\n",
      "done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have\n",
      "repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish\n",
      "aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been\n",
      "a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am\n",
      "glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing\n",
      "for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could\n",
      "have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not\n",
      "proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means\n",
      "certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to\n",
      "that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and\n",
      "giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you\n",
      "will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,\n",
      "I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.\n",
      "And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,\n",

      "you were right, it never would have done.”\n",

      "She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to\n",
      "be so, without looking at her, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of\n",

      "been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this\n",
      "home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had\n",
      "died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that\n",
      "I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from\n",
      "old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I\n",
      "have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off\n",
      "sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all\n",

      "heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in\n",

      "“The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come\n",

      "the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;\n",

      "\n",

      "the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and\n",
      "shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made\n",

      "shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be\n",

      "it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to\n",
      "you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that\n",

      "The Honest Tradesman\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in\n",
      "Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and\n",
      "variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit\n",
      "upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and\n",
      "not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending\n",
      "westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,\n",
      "both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where\n",
      "the sun goes down!\n",
      "\n",
      "With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,\n",
      "like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty\n",
      "watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever\n",
      "running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,\n",
      "since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid\n",
      "women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from\n",
      "Tellson’s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such\n",
      "companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed\n",
      "to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to\n",
      "have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from\n",
      "the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent\n",
      "purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in\n",
      "the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,\n",
      "but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were\n",
      "few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so\n",
      "unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.\n",
      "Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an\n",
      "unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his\n",
      "attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of\n",
      "funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this\n",
      "funeral, which engendered uproar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it’s a\n",
      "buryin’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious\n",
      "significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched\n",
      "his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What d’ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey\n",
      "to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for\n",
      "_me_!” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. “Him and his hooroars! Don’t\n",
      "let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D’ye\n",
      "hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I warn’t doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won’t have none of _your_ no\n",
      "harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing\n",
      "round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach\n",
      "there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were\n",
      "considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position\n",
      "appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble\n",
      "surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and\n",
      "incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!”\n",
      " with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he\n",
      "always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed\n",
      "Tellson’s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance\n",
      "excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it, brother? What’s it about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked another man. “Who is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth\n",
      "nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the\n",
      "greatest ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled\n",
      "against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the\n",
      "funeral of one Roger Cly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was he a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant. “Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey\n",
      "Spi--i--ies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had\n",
      "assisted. “I’ve seen him. Dead, is he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can’t be too dead. Have ’em\n",
      "out, there! Spies! Pull ’em out, there! Spies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,\n",
      "that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the\n",
      "suggestion to have ’em out, and to pull ’em out, mobbed the two vehicles\n",
      "so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd’s opening the coach\n",
      "doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands\n",
      "for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,\n",
      "that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after\n",
      "shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and\n",
      "other symbolical tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great\n",
      "enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a\n",
      "crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.\n",
      "They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin\n",
      "out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to\n",
      "its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being\n",
      "much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and\n",
      "the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,\n",
      "while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any\n",
      "exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers\n",
      "was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from\n",
      "the observation of Tellson’s, in the further corner of the mourning\n",
      "coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in\n",
      "the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices\n",
      "remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory\n",
      "members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.\n",
      "The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the\n",
      "hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under\n",
      "close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended\n",
      "by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a\n",
      "popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional\n",
      "ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his\n",
      "bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to\n",
      "that part of the procession in which he walked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite\n",
      "caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting\n",
      "at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination\n",
      "was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there\n",
      "in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,\n",
      "accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and\n",
      "highly to its own satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of\n",
      "providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter\n",
      "genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual\n",
      "passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase\n",
      "was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near\n",
      "the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and\n",
      "they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of\n",
      "window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy\n",
      "and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had\n",
      "been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm\n",
      "the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were\n",
      "coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps\n",
      "the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual\n",
      "progress of a mob.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained\n",
      "behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.\n",
      "The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a\n",
      "neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and\n",
      "maturely considering the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,\n",
      "“you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he\n",
      "was a young ’un and a straight made ’un.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned\n",
      "himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his\n",
      "station at Tellson’s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched\n",
      "his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all\n",
      "amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent\n",
      "man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon\n",
      "his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No\n",
      "job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the\n",
      "usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on\n",
      "entering. “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I\n",
      "shall make sure that you’ve been praying again me, and I shall work you\n",
      "for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, you’re at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of\n",
      "angry apprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am saying nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then; don’t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.\n",
      "You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Jerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. “Ah! It _is_\n",
      "yes, Jerry. That’s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,\n",
      "but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general\n",
      "ironical dissatisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his\n",
      "bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible\n",
      "oyster out of his saucer. “Ah! I think so. I believe you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took\n",
      "another bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you mayn’t. I’m a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That’s\n",
      "where I’m going to. Going a fishing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don’t it, father?”\n",

      "conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions\n",
      "to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in\n",
      "conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling\n",
      "on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than\n",
      "he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest\n",
      "person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an\n",

      "solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one\n",
      "o’clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,\n",
      "took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought\n",
      "forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other\n",
      "fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him\n",
      "in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,\n",

      "\n",
      "Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to\n",

      "followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the\n",
      "court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning\n",
      "his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the\n",
      "door stood ajar all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his\n",

      "walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his\n",
      "honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not\n",
      "gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and\n",
      "the two trudged on together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the\n",
      "winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a\n",
      "lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,\n",
      "that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the\n",
      "second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split\n",
      "himself into two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped\n",
      "under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low\n",
      "brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and\n",
      "wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which\n",
      "the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.\n",
      "Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that\n",
      "Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well\n",
      "defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.\n",
      "He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the\n",
      "third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay\n",
      "there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands\n",
      "and knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now Young Jerry’s turn to approach the gate: which he did,\n",
      "holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking\n",
      "in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!\n",
      "and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard\n",
      "that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church\n",
      "tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not\n",
      "creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to\n",
      "fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent\n",
      "appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.\n",
      "Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful\n",
      "striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,\n",
      "with his hair as stiff as his father’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not\n",
      "only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They\n",
      "were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for\n",
      "the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a\n",
      "screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were\n",
      "strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the\n",
      "earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what\n",
      "it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to\n",
      "wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he\n",
      "made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,\n",
      "it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable\n",
      "to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen\n",
      "was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt\n",
      "upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him\n",
      "and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to\n",
      "shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it\n",
      "was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the\n",
      "roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them\n",
      "like a dropsical boy’s kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways\n",
      "too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up\n",
      "to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,\n",
      "and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was\n",
      "incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy\n",
      "got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then\n",
      "it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every\n",
      "stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on\n",
      "his breast when he fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after\n",
      "daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the\n",
      "family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry\n",
      "inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the\n",
      "ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the\n",
      "bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and me\n",

      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband’s business? Is it\n",
      "honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your\n",
      "husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You hadn’t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a\n",
      "honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations\n",
      "when he took to his trade or when he didn’t. A honouring and obeying\n",
      "wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious\n",
      "woman? If you’re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have\n",
      "no more nat’ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has\n",
      "of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in\n",
      "the honest tradesman’s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down\n",
      "at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on\n",
      "his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay\n",
      "down too, and fell asleep again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.\n",
      "Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid\n",
      "by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case\n",
      "he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed\n",
      "and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his\n",
      "ostensible calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father’s side\n",
      "along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry\n",
      "from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and\n",
      "solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,\n",
      "and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not\n",
      "improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,\n",
      "that fine morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep\n",
      "at arm’s length and to have the stool well between them: “what’s a\n",
      "Resurrection-Man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How\n",
      "should I know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hem! Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his\n",
      "hat to give his spikes free play, “he’s a tradesman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, “is a\n",
      "branch of Scientific goods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Persons’ bodies, ain’t it, father?” asked the lively boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe it is something of that sort,” said Mr. Cruncher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I’m quite\n",
      "growed up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.\n",
      "“It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop\n",
      "your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and\n",
      "there’s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit\n",
      "for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,\n",
      "to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to\n",
      "himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there’s hopes wot that boy will\n",
      "yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!”\n",

      "There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge. As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping\n",
      "through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over\n",
      "measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best\n",
      "of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that\n",
      "he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its\n",
      "influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No\n",
      "vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in\n",
      "the dregs of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been\n",
      "early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun\n",
      "on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early\n",
      "brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and\n",
      "slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could\n",
      "not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These\n",
      "were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could\n",
      "have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,\n",
      "and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy\n",
      "looks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop\n",
      "was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the\n",
      "threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see\n",
      "only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of\n",
      "wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced\n",
      "and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of\n",
      "humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps\n",
      "observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in\n",
      "at every place, high and low, from the king’s palace to the criminal’s\n",
      "gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built\n",
      "towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops\n",
      "of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve\n",
      "with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible\n",
      "a long way off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was\n",
      "high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under\n",
      "his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a\n",
      "mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered\n",
      "the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast\n",
      "of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and\n",
      "flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had\n",
      "followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though\n",
      "the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited\n",
      "an answering chorus of “Good day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down\n",
      "their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I have\n",
      "travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called\n",
      "Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half’s journey out of Paris.\n",
      "He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to\n",
      "drink, my wife!”\n",
      "\n",
      "A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the\n",
      "mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,\n",
      "and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark\n",
      "bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near\n",
      "Madame Defarge’s counter. A third man got up and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less\n",
      "than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no\n",
      "rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.\n",
      "He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even\n",
      "Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, thank you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could\n",
      "occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a\n",
      "courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the\n",
      "staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man\n",
      "sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had\n",
      "gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired\n",
      "man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at\n",
      "him through the chinks in the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness\n",
      "encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.\n",
      "Speak, Jacques Five!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with\n",
      "it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge’s not unreasonable reply, “at the\n",
      "commencement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this\n",
      "running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the\n",
      "chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun\n",
      "going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he\n",
      "hanging by the chain--like this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which\n",
      "he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been\n",
      "the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village\n",
      "during a whole year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?\n",
      "\n",
      "“By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his\n",
      "finger at his nose. “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,\n",
      "‘Say, what is he like?’ I make response, ‘Tall as a spectre.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned Jacques Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he\n",
      "confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not\n",
      "offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,\n",
      "standing near our little fountain, and says, ‘To me! Bring that rascal!’\n",
      "My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had\n",
      "interrupted. “Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. “The tall man\n",
      "is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No matter, the number,” said Defarge. “He is well hidden, but at last\n",
      "he is unluckily found. Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to\n",

      "with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his\n",

      "spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I\n",
      "see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and\n",
      "that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun\n",
      "going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that\n",
      "their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the\n",
      "road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.\n",
      "Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves\n",
      "with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near\n",
      "to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would\n",
      "be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as\n",
      "on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it\n",
      "vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not\n",
      "show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with\n",
      "our eyes. ‘Come on!’ says the chief of that company, pointing to the\n",
      "village, ‘bring him fast to his tomb!’ and they bring him faster. I\n",
      "follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden\n",
      "shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and\n",
      "consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He imitated the action of a man’s being impelled forward by the\n",
      "butt-ends of muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They\n",
      "laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,\n",
      "but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into\n",
      "the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,\n",
      "and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the\n",
      "darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding\n",
      "snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by\n",
      "opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low\n",
      "voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the\n",
      "village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the\n",
      "locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,\n",
      "except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating\n",
      "my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on\n",
      "my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty\n",
      "iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no\n",
      "hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a\n",
      "dead man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all\n",
      "of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the\n",
      "countryman’s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was\n",
      "authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One\n",
      "and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on\n",
      "his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally\n",
      "intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding\n",
      "over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge\n",
      "standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the\n",
      "light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks\n",
      "at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a\n",
      "distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work\n",
      "of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all\n",
      "faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards\n",
      "the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They\n",
      "whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be\n",
      "executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing\n",
      "that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say\n",
      "that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?\n",
      "It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed.\n",
      "“Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,\n",
      "yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,\n",
      "sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the\n",
      "hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in\n",
      "his hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three:\n",
      "his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a\n",
      "strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither\n",
      "food nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,\n",
      "and struck him blows. You hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hear, messieurs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on then,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed the\n",
      "countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on\n",
      "the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper\n",
      "that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the\n",
      "father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a\n",
      "parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed\n",
      "with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds\n",
      "which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be\n",
      "poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,\n",
      "that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man\n",
      "says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on\n",
      "the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?\n",
      "I am not a scholar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless hand\n",
      "and the craving air. “The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was\n",
      "all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and\n",
      "nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than\n",
      "the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager\n",
      "attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,\n",
      "when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was\n",
      "done--why, how old are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience. “Long live the Devil! Go\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;\n",
      "even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday\n",
      "night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from\n",
      "the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.\n",
      "Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by\n",
      "the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the\n",
      "water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,\n",
      "and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,\n",
      "the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers\n",
      "have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst\n",
      "of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is\n",
      "a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he\n",
      "laughed.” He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,\n",
      "from the corners of his mouth to his ears. “On the top of the gallows is\n",
      "fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged\n",
      "there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,\n",
      "on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the\n",
      "spectacle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw\n",
      "water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have\n",
      "I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to\n",
      "bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,\n",
      "across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,\n",
      "messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other\n",
      "three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),\n",
      "and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was\n",
      "warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now\n",
      "walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here\n",
      "you see me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, “Good! You have acted\n",
      "and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the\n",
      "door?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very willingly,” said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the\n",
      "top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to\n",
      "the garret.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How say you, Jacques?” demanded Number One. “To be registered?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The chateau, and all the race?” inquired the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The chateau and all the race,” returned Defarge. “Extermination.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and began\n",
      "gnawing another finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you sure,” asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, “that no embarrassment\n",
      "can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is\n",
      "safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always\n",
      "be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jacques,” returned Defarge, drawing himself up, “if madame my wife\n",
      "undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose\n",
      "a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her\n",
      "own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in\n",
      "Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,\n",
      "to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or\n",
      "crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who\n",
      "hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is\n",
      "very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than would\n",
      "easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself\n",
      "with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him\n",
      "on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and\n",
      "Court; let him see them on Sunday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring. “Is it a good sign, that he\n",
      "wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jacques,” said Defarge; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her\n",
      "to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish\n",
      "him to bring it down one day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already\n",
      "dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the\n",
      "pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse quarters than Defarge’s wine-shop, could easily have been found\n",
      "in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious\n",
      "dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very\n",
      "new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly\n",
      "unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that\n",
      "his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that\n",
      "he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he\n",
      "contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady\n",
      "might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it\n",
      "into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a\n",
      "murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through\n",
      "with it until the play was played out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted\n",
      "(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur\n",
      "and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have\n",
      "madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was\n",
      "additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the\n",
      "afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to\n",
      "see the carriage of the King and Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You work hard, madame,” said a man near her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Madame Defarge; “I have a good deal to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you make, madame?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For instance--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For instance,” returned Madame Defarge, composedly, “shrouds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender\n",
      "of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close\n",
      "and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was\n",
      "fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King\n",
      "and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the\n",
      "shining Bull’s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing\n",
      "ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour\n",
      "and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both\n",
      "sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary\n",
      "intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,\n",
      "Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of\n",
      "ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,\n",
      "terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull’s Eye,\n",
      "more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept\n",
      "with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three\n",
      "hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,\n",
      "and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him\n",
      "from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a\n",
      "patron; “you are a good boy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of\n",
      "having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are the fellow we want,” said Defarge, in his ear; “you make\n",
      "these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more\n",
      "insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that’s true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would\n",
      "stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than\n",
      "in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath\n",
      "tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot\n",
      "deceive them too much.”\n",

      "scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead\n",
      "stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and\n",

      "journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier\n",
      "guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual\n",
      "examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two\n",
      "of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate\n",
      "with, and affectionately embraced.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,\n",
      "and they, having finally alighted near the Saint’s boundaries, were\n",
      "picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his\n",
      "streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy\n",
      "commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he\n",
      "can say, but he knows of one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh well!” said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool\n",
      "business air. “It is necessary to register him. How do they call that\n",
      "man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is English.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So much the better. His name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had\n",
      "been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect\n",
      "correctness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad,” repeated madame. “Good. Christian name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.\n",
      "“Good. His appearance; is it known?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;\n",
      "complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face\n",
      "thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a\n",
      "peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,\n",
      "sinister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh my faith. It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing. “He shall be\n",
      "registered to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),\n",
      "and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted\n",
      "the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the\n",
      "stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of\n",
      "her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally\n",
      "dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl\n",
      "of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her\n",
      "handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the\n",
      "night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked\n",
      "up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which\n",
      "condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he\n",
      "walked up and down through life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a\n",
      "neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge’s olfactory sense was\n",
      "by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than\n",
      "it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He\n",
      "whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the\n",
      "money. “There are only the usual odours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had\n",
      "never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for\n",
      "him. “Oh, the men, the men!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my dear!” began Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear! You are\n",
      "faint of heart to-night, my dear!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his\n",
      "breast, “it _is_ a long time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time?\n",
      "Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,” said\n",
      "Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to make and store\n",
      "the lightning? Tell me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that\n",
      "too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake to\n",
      "swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the\n",
      "earthquake?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A long time, I suppose,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything\n",
      "before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not\n",
      "seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,\n",
      "“that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and\n",
      "coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it\n",
      "is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world\n",
      "that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider\n",
      "the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with\n",
      "more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his head\n",
      "a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and\n",
      "attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this. But\n",
      "it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,\n",
      "it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh well! How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there\n",
      "were another enemy strangled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.\n",
      "“We shall not see the triumph.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shall have helped it,” returned madame, with her extended hand in\n",
      "strong action. “Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all\n",
      "my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew\n",
      "certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I\n",
      "would--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold!” cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with\n",
      "cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim\n",
      "and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.\n",
      "When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the\n",
      "time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her\n",
      "little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains\n",
      "out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene\n",
      "manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the\n",
      "wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she\n",
      "now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her\n",
      "usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not\n",
      "drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,\n",
      "and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous\n",
      "perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell\n",
      "dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies\n",
      "out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they\n",
      "themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met\n",
      "the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they\n",
      "thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.\n",
      "\n",
      "A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she\n",
      "felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her\n",
      "rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the\n",
      "customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the\n",
      "wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, madame,” said the new-comer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:\n",
      "“Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black\n",
      "hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,\n",
      "thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a\n",
      "peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister\n",
      "expression! Good day, one and all!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a\n",
      "mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame complied with a polite air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marvellous cognac this, madame!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame\n",
      "Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,\n",
      "however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The\n",
      "visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity\n",
      "of observing the place in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You knit with great skill, madame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am accustomed to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A pretty pattern too!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You_ think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her\n",
      "fingers moved nimbly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not for use?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,” said\n",
      "madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of\n",
      "coquetry, “I’ll use it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be\n",
      "decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two\n",
      "men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,\n",
      "catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of\n",
      "looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.\n",
      "Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there\n",
      "one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,\n",
      "but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a\n",
      "poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and\n",
      "unimpeachable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_John_,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,\n",
      "and her eyes looked at the stranger. “Stay long enough, and I shall knit\n",
      "‘BARSAD’ before you go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have a husband, madame?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Children?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Business seems bad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Business is very bad; the people are so poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As _you_ say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an\n",
      "extra something into his name that boded him no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.\n",
      "Of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ think?” returned madame, in a high voice. “I and my husband have\n",
      "enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we\n",
      "think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and\n",
      "it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without\n",
      "embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did\n",
      "not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,\n",
      "stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame\n",
      "Defarge’s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard’s execution. Ah! the poor\n",
      "Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My faith!” returned madame, coolly and lightly, “if people use knives\n",
      "for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the\n",
      "price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone\n",
      "that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary\n",
      "susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there\n",
      "is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor\n",
      "fellow? Between ourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there?” asked madame, vacantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--Here is my husband!” said Madame Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted\n",
      "him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good day,\n",
      "Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, Jacques!” the spy repeated; with not quite so much\n",
      "confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wine-shop.\n",
      "“You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good\n",
      "day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day!” answered Defarge, drily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when\n",
      "you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy\n",
      "and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head. “I know nothing\n",
      "of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his\n",
      "hand on the back of his wife’s chair, looking over that barrier at the\n",
      "person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would\n",
      "have shot with the greatest satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious\n",
      "attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh\n",
      "water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it\n",
      "out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?”\n",
      " observed Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested\n",
      "in its miserable inhabitants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” muttered Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,”\n",
      " pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting\n",
      "associations with your name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed!” said Defarge, with much indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,\n",
      "had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am\n",
      "informed of the circumstances?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such is the fact, certainly,” said Defarge. He had had it conveyed\n",
      "to him, in an accidental touch of his wife’s elbow as she knitted and\n",
      "warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was\n",
      "from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown\n",
      "monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of\n",
      "Tellson and Company--over to England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such is the fact,” repeated Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very interesting remembrances!” said the spy. “I have known Doctor\n",
      "Manette and his daughter, in England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes?” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t hear much about them now?” said the spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little\n",
      "song, “we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe\n",
      "arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,\n",
      "they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held\n",
      "no correspondence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy. “She is going to be married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Going?” echoed madame. “She was pretty enough to have been married long\n",
      "ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! You know I am English.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the tongue is, I\n",
      "suppose the man is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best\n",
      "of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the\n",
      "end, he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to\n",
      "one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,\n",
      "poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is\n",
      "going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard\n",
      "was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present\n",
      "Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is\n",
      "Mr. Charles Darnay. D’Aulnais is the name of his mother’s family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable\n",
      "effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,\n",
      "as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was\n",
      "troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no\n",
      "spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be\n",
      "worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad\n",
      "paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,\n",
      "in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the\n",
      "pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes\n",
      "after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the\n",
      "husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should\n",
      "come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can it be true,” said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife\n",
      "as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what he has\n",
      "said of Ma’amselle Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As he has said it,” returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, “it\n",
      "is probably false. But it may be true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it is--” Defarge began, and stopped.\n",
      "\n",

      "that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I\n",
      "could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines\n",
      "with which I could intersect them.” He added in his inward and pondering\n",

      "been born alive, or the poor mother’s shock had killed it. Whether it\n",
      "was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my\n",
      "imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it\n",
      "was a son who would never know his father’s story; who might even live\n",

      "me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have\n",
      "cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married\n",
      "to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from\n",
      "the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a\n",
      "blank.”\n",

      "foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and\n",
      "leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her\n",
      "image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held\n",

      "\n",
      "“No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of\n",
      "sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another\n",
      "and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than\n",
      "that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you\n",
      "have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?\n",

      "perplexed distinctions.”\n",

      "coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married\n",
      "life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture\n",
      "was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,\n",
      "cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love\n",
      "that was I.”\n",

      "“And she showed me her children,” said the Doctor of Beauvais, “and\n",
      "they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed\n",
      "a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked\n",
      "up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I\n",
      "imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.\n",
      "But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and\n",
      "blessed her.”\n",
      "\n",

      "change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,\n",
      "by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the\n",
      "apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only\n",
      "three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles\n",
      "was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving\n",
      "little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.\n",
      "But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came\n",

      "beforehand.\n",

      "All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay\n",
      "asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his\n",
      "hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the\n",
      "shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;\n",
      "then, leaned over him, and looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he\n",
      "covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the\n",
      "mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,\n",
      "resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be\n",
      "beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that\n",
      "she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his\n",
      "sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once\n",
      "more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves\n",

      "her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and\n",
      "I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final\n",
      "opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave\n",
      "your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your\n",
      "own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next\n",

      "shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at\n",
      "the fortnight’s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on\n",

      "For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the\n",
      "well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright\n",

      "delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the Doctor’s room opened, and he came out with Charles\n",

      "He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot\n",

      "\n",
      "The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the\n",
      "preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,\n",
      "and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into\n",
      "the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great\n",
      "change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted\n",
      "there, had struck him a poisoned blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been\n",
      "expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was\n",
      "the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent\n",
      "manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own\n",
      "room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the\n",
      "wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think,” he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, “I\n",
      "think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.\n",
      "I must look in at Tellson’s; so I will go there at once and come back\n",
      "presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine\n",
      "there, and all will be well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson’s, than to look out of\n",
      "Tellson’s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the\n",
      "old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus\n",
      "into the Doctor’s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God!” he said, with a start. “What’s that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. “O me, O me! All is\n",
      "lost!” cried she, wringing her hands. “What is to be told to Ladybird?\n",
      "He doesn’t know me, and is making shoes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the\n",
      "Doctor’s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been\n",
      "when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent\n",
      "down, and he was very busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he\n",
      "were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the\n",
      "throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old\n",
      "haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked\n",
      "hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a\n",
      "shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by\n",
      "him, and asked what it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A young lady’s walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up. “It\n",
      "ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in\n",
      "his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper\n",
      "occupation. Think, dear friend!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at\n",
      "a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract\n",
      "a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and\n",
      "words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on\n",
      "the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that\n",
      "he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there\n",
      "seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were\n",
      "trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above\n",
      "all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;\n",
      "the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In\n",
      "conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter\n",
      "precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a\n",
      "few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised\n",
      "on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been\n",
      "called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of\n",
      "two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been\n",
      "addressed to her by the same post.\n",
      "\n",
      "These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in\n",
      "the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept\n",
      "another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he\n",
      "thought the best, on the Doctor’s case.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course\n",
      "being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him\n",
      "attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He\n",
      "therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson’s for the\n",
      "first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak\n",
      "to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that\n",
      "attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always\n",
      "before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had\n",
      "fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the\n",
      "window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and\n",
      "natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,\n",
      "that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour\n",
      "after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.\n",
      "When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose\n",
      "and said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you go out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,\n",
      "looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,\n",
      "with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in\n",
      "some misty way asking himself, “Why not?” The sagacity of the man of\n",
      "business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him\n",
      "at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long\n",
      "time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he\n",
      "fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his\n",
      "bench and to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,\n",
      "and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He\n",
      "returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and\n",
      "that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry\n",
      "to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;\n",
      "at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then\n",
      "present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing\n",
      "amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long\n",
      "enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he\n",
      "appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Doctor, will you go out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, he repeated, “Out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer\n",
      "from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the\n",
      "meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had\n",
      "sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry’s return, he\n",
      "slipped away to his bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry’s hope darkened, and his\n",
      "heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.\n",
      "The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,\n",
      "seven days, eight days, nine days.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and\n",
      "heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was\n",
      "well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to\n",
      "observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,\n",
      "was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on\n",
      "his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in\n",
      "the dusk of the ninth evening.\n",

      "CHAPTER XIX.\n",
      "An Opinion\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\n",
      "tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\n",
      "into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\n",
      "done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\n",
      "Doctor’s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker’s bench\n",
      "and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\n",
      "at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\n",
      "Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\n",
      "studious and attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\n",
      "giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\n",
      "not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\n",
      "friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\n",
      "as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\n",
      "which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\n",
      "answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\n",
      "corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\n",
      "How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\n",
      "Manette’s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\n",
      "Doctor’s bedroom door in the early morning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\n",
      "had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\n",
      "resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\n",
      "He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\n",
      "breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\n",
      "had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\n",
      "the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\n",
      "out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\n",
      "toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\n",
      "white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\n",
      "usual way, and came to breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\n",
      "delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\n",
      "advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had taken\n",
      "place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\n",
      "the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\n",
      "counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\n",
      "he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\n",
      "he sought. And that aid was his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\n",
      "Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\n",
      "very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\n",
      "very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\n",
      "so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\n",
      "Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\n",
      "at his hands more than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\n",
      "arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\n",
      "give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\n",
      "for his daughter’s--his daughter’s, my dear Manette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I understand,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental\n",
      "shock--?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be explicit,” said the Doctor. “Spare no detail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\n",
      "of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\n",
      "the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\n",
      "shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\n",
      "long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\n",
      "are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\n",
      "which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\n",
      "himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\n",
      "the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\n",
      "be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\n",
      "great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\n",
      "stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\n",
      "there has been,” he paused and took a deep breath--“a slight relapse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nine days and nights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did it show itself? I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in the\n",
      "resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the fact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, did you ever see him,” asked the Doctor, distinctly and\n",
      "collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit\n",
      "originally?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\n",
      "respects--as he was then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think in all respects.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.\n",
      "It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind. That was\n",
      "very thoughtful!” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of\n",
      "the two spoke for a little while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\n",
      "considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business,\n",
      "and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not\n",
      "possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of\n",
      "intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom\n",
      "I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this\n",
      "relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it\n",
      "be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come\n",
      "about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been\n",
      "more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,\n",
      "if I knew how.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,\n",
      "knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be\n",
      "able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.\n",
      "Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,\n",
      "and teach me how to be a little more useful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and\n",
      "Mr. Lorry did not press him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it probable,” said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,\n",
      "“that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite\n",
      "unforeseen by its subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was it dreaded by him?” Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much.” He said it with an involuntary shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer’s\n",
      "mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force\n",
      "himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would he,” asked Mr. Lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail\n",
      "upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even\n",
      "believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor’s arm again,\n",
      "after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this\n",
      "attack?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe,” returned Doctor Manette, “that there had been a strong and\n",
      "extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that\n",
      "was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most\n",
      "distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that\n",
      "there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations\n",
      "would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a\n",
      "particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the\n",
      "effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr. Lorry,\n",
      "with natural hesitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and\n",
      "answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to the future,” said the Doctor, recovering firmness, “I should have\n",
      "great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I\n",
      "should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated\n",
      "something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,\n",
      "and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that\n",
      "the worst was over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well! That’s good comfort. I am thankful!” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am thankful!” repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are two other points,” said Mr. Lorry, “on which I am anxious to\n",
      "be instructed. I may go on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You cannot do your friend a better service.” The Doctor gave him his\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;\n",
      "he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional\n",
      "knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does\n",
      "he do too much?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,\n",
      "when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be\n",
      "dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,\n",

      "Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:\n",
      "doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided\n",

      "be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her\n",
      "eyes, and broke like waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the\n",
      "advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of\n",
      "her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young\n",
      "mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and\n",

      "Thus, the rustling of an Angel’s wings got blended with the other\n",
      "echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath\n",
      "of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were\n",
      "mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed\n",
      "murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as\n",

      "blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,\n",

      "delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in\n",
      "such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton\n",
      "was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,\n",

      "These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most\n",
      "offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three\n",
      "sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to\n",
      "Lucie’s husband: delicately saying “Halloa! here are three lumps of\n",
      "bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!” The polite\n",
      "rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.\n",
      "Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the\n",
      "training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the\n",
      "pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of\n",
      "declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts\n",
      "Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the\n",

      "parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the\n",
      "latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed\n",

      "off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes\n",
      "amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little\n",

      "child’s tread came, and those of her own dear father’s, always active\n",
      "and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband’s, need not be told.\n",
      "Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself\n",
      "with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any\n",
      "waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet\n",

      "more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the\n",

      "have too much to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly\n",
      "in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about\n",
      "little Lucie’s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,\n",

      "\n",
      "On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.\n",

      "her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were\n",
      "all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the\n",
      "lightning from the same place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I began to think,” said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, “that\n",
      "I should have to pass the night at Tellson’s. We have been so full of\n",
      "business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way\n",
      "to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a\n",
      "run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able\n",
      "to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania\n",
      "among some of them for sending it to England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That has a bad look,” said Darnay--\n",
      "\n",
      "“A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don’t know what reason\n",
      "there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson’s are\n",
      "getting old, and we really can’t be troubled out of the ordinary course\n",
      "without due occasion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Still,” said Darnay, “you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.”\n",
      "\n",

      "himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, “but I\n",

      "Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here he is,” said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by\n",

      "\n",

      "“Not a theory; it was a fancy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A fancy, then, my wise pet,” said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. “They\n",

      "Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody’s\n",

      "the dark London window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows\n",
      "heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy\n",
      "heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous\n",
      "roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms\n",
      "struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:\n",
      "all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a\n",
      "weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what\n",
      "agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the\n",
      "heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could\n",

      "powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every\n",
      "weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who\n",
      "could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to\n",
      "force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and\n",
      "heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.\n",
      "Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented\n",
      "with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging\n",
      "circled round Defarge’s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron\n",
      "had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,\n",
      "already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,\n",
      "thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm\n",
      "another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep near to me, Jacques Three,” cried Defarge; “and do you, Jacques\n",

      "\n",
      "“Eh, well! Here you see me!” said madame, composed as ever, but not\n",
      "knitting to-day. Madame’s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,\n",

      "\n",
      "With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped\n",

      "depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums\n",

      "began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great\n",
      "towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through\n",

      "revenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single\n",

      "at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,\n",
      "execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the\n",
      "furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the\n",
      "single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great\n",

      "by the service of Four fierce hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly\n",
      "perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly\n",
      "the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the\n",

      "\n",
      "So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to\n",

      "struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the\n",
      "outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he\n",
      "made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side;\n",
      "Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the\n",
      "inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult,\n",

      "eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost\n",
      "billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and\n",
      "threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained\n",
      "undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of\n",
      "these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his\n",
      "hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the\n",
      "wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Show me the North Tower!” said Defarge. “Quick!”\n",

      "by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,\n",
      "held by Defarge’s arm as he held by the turnkey’s. Their three heads had\n",
      "been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much\n",
      "as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the\n",
      "noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and\n",
      "its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around\n",
      "outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,\n",
      "occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the\n",
      "air like spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past\n",
      "hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,\n",

      "waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,\n",
      "linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and\n",
      "there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;\n",
      "but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a\n",
      "tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls\n",
      "and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible\n",
      "to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had\n",
      "come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung\n",

      "in:\n",
      "\n",
      "“One hundred and five, North Tower!”\n",
      "\n",

      "with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by\n",
      "stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred\n",
      "across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes\n",
      "on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were\n",
      "the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,” said\n",

      "“A. M.!” croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alexandre Manette,” said Defarge in his ear, following the letters\n",
      "with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. “And here he\n",

      "a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it\n",
      "me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden\n",
      "exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and\n",
      "table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold the light higher!” he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. “Look\n",
      "among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,”\n",

      "light higher, you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and,\n",
      "peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,\n",
      "and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar\n",
      "and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and\n",
      "in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney\n",
      "into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a\n",
      "cautious touch.\n",

      "them, you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping\n",
      "again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and\n",
      "retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense\n",
      "of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once\n",
      "more.\n",
      "\n",
      "They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint\n",

      "upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.\n",
      "Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for\n",
      "judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people’s\n",

      "\n",
      "In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to\n",
      "encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red\n",

      "woman’s. “See, there is my husband!” she cried, pointing him out.\n",
      "“See Defarge!” She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and\n",
      "remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through\n",
      "the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable\n",
      "close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to\n",
      "be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the\n",
      "long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him\n",

      "upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea\n",
      "of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint\n",
      "Antoine’s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the\n",
      "iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the\n",
      "governor’s body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge\n",
      "where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. “Lower\n",
      "the lamp yonder!” cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new\n",
      "means of death; “here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!” The\n",
      "swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving\n",
      "of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces\n",

      "more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly\n",
      "released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high\n",

      "Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften\n",
      "his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with\n",
      "the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame\n",
      "Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.\n",
      "Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of\n",
      "Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting\n",
      "themselves to the saint’s mercies. The lamps across his streets had a\n",
      "portentously elastic swing with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,\n",
      "contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several\n",
      "knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense\n",
      "of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on\n",
      "the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how\n",
      "hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;\n",
      "but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to\n",
      "destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had been without work\n",
      "before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.\n",
      "The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that\n",
      "they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;\n",
      "the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the\n",
      "last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was\n",
      "to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her\n",
      "sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a starved\n",
      "grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had\n",
      "already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hark!” said The Vengeance. “Listen, then! Who comes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine\n",
      "Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading\n",

      "\n",
      "“It is Defarge,” said madame. “Silence, patriots!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked\n",
      "around him! “Listen, everywhere!” said madame again. “Listen to him!”\n",
      " Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not dead! He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself\n",
      "to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have\n",
      "found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have\n",
      "seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have\n",

      "\n",
      "A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked\n",
      "steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum\n",
      "was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Patriots!” said Defarge, in a determined voice, “are we ready?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly Madame Defarge’s knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating\n",
      "in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and\n",
      "The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about\n",
      "her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to\n",
      "house, rousing the women.\n",
      "\n",
      "The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked\n",
      "from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into\n",
      "the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From\n",
      "such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their\n",
      "children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground\n",
      "famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one\n",
      "another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.\n",
      "Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant\n",
      "Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of\n",
      "these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon\n",
      "alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon\n",
      "who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread\n",
      "to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these\n",
      "breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our\n",
      "suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my\n",
      "knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers,\n",
      "and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,\n",
      "Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend\n",
      "Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from\n",
      "him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,\n",
      "whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they\n",
      "dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men\n",
      "belonging to them from being trampled under foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at\n",
      "the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew\n",
      "his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out\n",
      "of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with\n",
      "such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not\n",
      "a human creature in Saint Antoine’s bosom but a few old crones and the\n",
      "wailing children.\n",
      "\n",
      "No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where\n",
      "this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent\n",
      "open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,\n",
      "and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance\n",
      "from him in the Hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife. “See the old villain bound\n",
      "with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.\n",
      "Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!” Madame put her knife\n",
      "under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.\n",

      "The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of\n",
      "her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to\n",
      "others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the\n",
      "clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,\n",
      "and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge’s frequent\n",
      "expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at\n",
      "a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some\n",
      "wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture\n",
      "to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a\n",
      "telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or\n",
      "protection, directly down upon the old prisoner’s head. The favour was\n",
      "too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had\n",
      "stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got\n",
      "him!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge\n",
      "had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable\n",
      "wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned\n",
      "her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and\n",
      "Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows\n",
      "had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high\n",
      "perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him\n",
      "out! Bring him to the lamp!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on\n",
      "his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,\n",
      "and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his\n",
      "face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always\n",
      "entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of\n",
      "action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one\n",
      "another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through\n",
      "a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one\n",
      "of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat\n",
      "might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him\n",
      "while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately\n",
      "screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have\n",
      "him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope\n",
      "broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope\n",
      "broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and\n",
      "held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the\n",
      "mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was this the end of the day’s bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted\n",
      "and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when\n",
      "the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the\n",
      "people’s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard\n",
      "five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes\n",
      "on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the\n",
      "breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on\n",
      "pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession\n",
      "through the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,\n",
      "wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers’ shops were beset by\n",
      "long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while\n",
      "they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by\n",
      "embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them\n",
      "again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and\n",
      "frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and\n",
      "slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in\n",
      "common, afterwards supping at their doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of\n",
      "most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused\n",
      "some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of\n",
      "cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full\n",
      "share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;\n",
      "and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and\n",
      "hoped.\n",

      "poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the\n",

      "it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures\n",
      "of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting\n",

      "of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were\n",
      "footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed\n",
      "with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long\n",
      "leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into\n",
      "sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at\n",
      "secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept\n",
      "with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.\n",
      "Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and\n",
      "drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against\n",

      "looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no\n",
      "obstacle, tending to centres all over France.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of\n",
      "brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps\n",
      "of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed\n",
      "them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,\n",
      "the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready\n",
      "to go down into the village, roused him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. “Two leagues beyond the\n",

      "\n",
      "“About. Good!”\n",

      "The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him\n",
      "according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,\n",
      "squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and\n",
      "appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.\n",
      "When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,\n",
      "as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A\n",
      "curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered\n",
      "together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of\n",
      "looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,\n",
      "chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top\n",
      "alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his\n",
      "chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to\n",
      "the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need\n",
      "to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its\n",
      "solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened\n",
      "the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace\n",
      "flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a\n",
      "swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through\n",
      "the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the\n",
      "stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis\n",
      "had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four\n",
      "heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the\n",
      "branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four\n",
      "lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all\n",
      "was black again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely\n",
      "visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.\n",
      "Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,\n",
      "picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,\n",
      "and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.\n",
      "Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the\n",
      "stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left\n",
      "there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was\n",
      "spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the\n",
      "space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur\n",
      "Gabelle’s door. “Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!” The tocsin rang\n",
      "impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The\n",
      "mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood\n",
      "with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the\n",
      "sky. “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away\n",
      "through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on\n",
      "the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;\n",
      "removed from them, a group of soldiers. “Help, gentlemen--officers! The\n",
      "chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by\n",
      "timely aid! Help, help!” The officers looked towards the soldiers who\n",
      "looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting\n",
      "of lips, “It must burn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the\n",
      "village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and\n",
      "fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of\n",
      "lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in\n",
      "every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,\n",
      "occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of\n",
      "Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on\n",
      "that functionary’s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to\n",
      "authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,\n",
      "and that post-horses would roast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and\n",
      "raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the\n",
      "infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising\n",
      "and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in\n",
      "torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the\n",
      "two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke\n",
      "again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake\n",
      "and contending with the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,\n",
      "scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce\n",
      "figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten\n",
      "lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran\n",
      "dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the\n",
      "heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and\n",
      "splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied\n",
      "birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures\n",
      "trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded\n",
      "roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next\n",
      "destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,\n",
      "abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and\n",
      "bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with\n",
      "the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment\n",
      "of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter\n",
      "days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his\n",
      "house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,\n",
      "Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel\n",
      "with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again\n",
      "withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time\n",
      "resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man\n",
      "of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the\n",
      "parapet, and crush a man or two below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the\n",
      "distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,\n",
      "combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an\n",
      "ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,\n",
      "which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.\n",
      "A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of\n",
      "the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur\n",
      "Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the\n",
      "rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,\n",
      "and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that\n",
      "while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were\n",
      "other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom\n",

      "less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the\n",

      "in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,\n",

      "the series that was barred between him and England. The universal\n",
      "watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net,\n",
      "or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have\n",

      "by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been\n",

      "change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay\n",
      "between them and the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and\n",
      "lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,\n",
      "that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged\n",
      "shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of\n",
      "being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger\n",
      "as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying\n",
      "his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint\n",
      "that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,\n",
      "he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits\n",
      "of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,\n",
      "confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,\n",
      "when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from\n",
      "himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd\n",
      "gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called\n",
      "out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,\n",
      "resuming it as his safest place, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own\n",
      "will?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a\n",
      "furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a cursed\n",
      "aristocrat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider’s\n",
      "bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let him\n",
      "be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Judged!” repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. “Ay! and condemned\n",
      "as a traitor.” At this the crowd roared approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse’s head to the\n",
      "yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with\n",
      "the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his\n",
      "voice heard:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a\n",
      "traitor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He lies!” cried the smith. “He is a traitor since the decree. His life\n",
      "is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which\n",
      "another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his\n",
      "horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse’s flanks,\n",
      "and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier\n",
      "struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no\n",
      "more was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this decree that the smith spoke of?” Darnay asked the\n",
      "postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When passed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the fourteenth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The day I left England!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be\n",
      "others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and\n",
      "condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said\n",
      "your life was not your own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there are no such decrees yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; “there\n",
      "may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and\n",
      "then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many\n",
      "wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride\n",
      "unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and\n",
      "lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor\n",
      "cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and\n",
      "would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,\n",
      "circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn\n",
      "up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in\n",
      "Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more\n",
      "into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and\n",
      "wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth\n",
      "that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by\n",
      "the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their\n",
      "way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was\n",
      "closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolute-looking man\n",
      "in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the\n",
      "speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,\n",
      "in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had\n",
      "imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him\n",
      "whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his\n",
      "eyes over Gabelle’s letter, the same personage in authority showed some\n",
      "disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went\n",
      "into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the\n",
      "gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles\n",
      "Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and\n",
      "patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress\n",
      "into the city for peasants’ carts bringing in supplies, and for similar\n",
      "traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest\n",
      "people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not\n",
      "to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue\n",
      "forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they\n",
      "filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew\n",
      "their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the\n",
      "ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered\n",
      "about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men\n",
      "and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these\n",
      "things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,\n",
      "who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the\n",
      "escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him\n",
      "to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,\n",
      "turned and rode away without entering the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine\n",
      "and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,\n",
      "drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and\n",
      "waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The\n",
      "light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of\n",
      "the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly\n",
      "uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an\n",
      "officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Citizen Defarge,” said he to Darnay’s conductor, as he took a slip of\n",
      "paper to write on. “Is this the emigrant Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your age, Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thirty-seven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Married, Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where married?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without doubt. You are consigned, Evrémonde, to the prison of La\n",
      "Force.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just Heaven!” exclaimed Darnay. “Under what law, and for what offence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have new laws, Evrémonde, and new offences, since you were here.” He\n",
      "said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response\n",
      "to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I\n",
      "demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that\n",
      "my right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emigrants have no rights, Evrémonde,” was the stolid reply. The officer\n",
      "wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,\n",
      "sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words “In secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany\n",
      "him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the\n",
      "guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, “who married the daughter of\n",
      "Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint\n",
      "Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The word “wife” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say\n",
      "with sudden impatience, “In the name of that sharp female newly-born,\n",
      "and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the\n",
      "truth?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A bad truth for you,” said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and\n",
      "looking straight before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so\n",
      "sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a\n",
      "little help?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None.” Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you answer me a single question?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free\n",
      "communication with the world outside?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of\n",
      "presenting my case?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried\n",
      "in worse prisons, before now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But never by me, Citizen Defarge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady\n",
      "and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope\n",
      "there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.\n",
      "He, therefore, made haste to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better\n",
      "than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to\n",
      "Mr. Lorry of Tellson’s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,\n",
      "the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the\n",
      "prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will do,” Defarge doggedly rejoined, “nothing for you. My duty is to\n",
      "my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.\n",
      "I will do nothing for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride\n",
      "was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see\n",
      "how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the\n",
      "streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned\n",
      "their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;\n",
      "otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no\n",
      "more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be\n",
      "going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they\n",
      "passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited\n",
      "audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal\n",
      "family. The few words that he caught from this man’s lips, first made\n",
      "it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the\n",
      "foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at\n",
      "Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal\n",
      "watchfulness had completely isolated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had\n",
      "developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That\n",
      "perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster\n",
      "yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he\n",
      "might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events\n",
      "of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by\n",
      "the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future\n",
      "was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant\n",
      "hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few\n",
      "rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed\n",
      "garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had\n",
      "been a hundred thousand years away. The “sharp female newly-born, and\n",
      "called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to the generality\n",
      "of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were\n",
      "probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could\n",
      "they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation\n",
      "from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the\n",
      "certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on\n",
      "his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he\n",
      "arrived at the prison of La Force.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge\n",
      "presented “The Emigrant Evrémonde.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the Devil! How many more of them!” exclaimed the man with the\n",
      "bloated face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,\n",
      "with his two fellow-patriots.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the Devil, I say again!” exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.\n",
      "“How many more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The gaoler’s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely\n",
      "replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys who entered\n",
      "responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, “For\n",
      "the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a\n",
      "horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome\n",
      "flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that\n",
      "are ill cared for!\n",
      "\n",
      "“In secret, too,” grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. “As\n",
      "if I was not already full to bursting!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay\n",
      "awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and\n",
      "fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in\n",
      "either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his\n",
      "subordinates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with me,\n",
      "emigrant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by\n",
      "corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,\n",
      "until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with\n",
      "prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading\n",
      "and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the\n",
      "most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and\n",
      "disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning\n",
      "unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to\n",
      "receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with\n",
      "all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and\n",
      "gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and\n",
      "misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand\n",
      "in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost\n",
      "of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of\n",
      "frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all\n",
      "waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes\n",
      "that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other\n",
      "gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance\n",
      "in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly\n",
      "coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were\n",
      "there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the\n",
      "mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and\n",
      "likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its\n",
      "utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress\n",
      "of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a\n",
      "gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have the\n",
      "honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you\n",
      "on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate\n",
      "happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,\n",
      "to ask your name and condition?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in\n",
      "words as suitable as he could find.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his\n",
      "eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say\n",
      "so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several\n",
      "members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted\n",
      "but a short time.” Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform\n",
      "the society--in secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room\n",
      "to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among\n",
      "which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave\n",
      "him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to\n",
      "render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler’s hand; and\n",
      "the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had\n",
      "ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted\n",
      "them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a\n",
      "solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yours,” said the gaoler.\n",

      "There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As\n",
      "the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four\n",
      "walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of\n",
      "the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler\n",
      "was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like\n",
      "a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was\n",
      "gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were\n",
      "dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it\n",
      "with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures\n",
      "is the first condition of the body after death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five\n",

      "counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled\n",
      "drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. “He made shoes, he made\n",
      "shoes, he made shoes.” The prisoner counted the measurement again, and\n",
      "paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.\n",
      "“The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among\n",
      "them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the\n",
      "embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden\n",
      "hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God’s sake,\n",
      "through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He\n",
      "made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and\n",
      "a half.” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of\n",
      "his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting\n",
      "and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it\n",
      "still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he\n",
      "knew, in the swell that rose above them.\n",

      "Tellson’s Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was\n",
      "in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from\n",
      "the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to\n",
      "a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the\n",
      "troubles, in his own cook’s dress, and got across the borders. A\n",
      "mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his\n",
      "metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation\n",
      "of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men\n",
      "besides the cook in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the\n",
      "sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and\n",
      "willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and\n",
      "indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur’s\n",
      "house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all\n",
      "things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce\n",
      "precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month\n",
      "of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of\n",
      "Monseigneur’s house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were\n",
      "drinking brandy in its state apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "A place of business in London like Tellson’s place of business in Paris,\n",
      "would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.\n",
      "For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have\n",
      "said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid\n",
      "over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson’s had whitewashed the\n",
      "Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest\n",
      "linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to\n",
      "night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in\n",
      "Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of\n",
      "the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and\n",
      "also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest\n",
      "provocation. Yet, a French Tellson’s could get on with these things\n",
      "exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had\n",
      "taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.\n",
      "\n",
      "What money would be drawn out of Tellson’s henceforth, and what would\n",
      "lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in\n",
      "Tellson’s hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons,\n",
      "and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with\n",
      "Tellson’s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into\n",
      "the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis\n",
      "Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by\n",
      "a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was\n",
      "prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a\n",
      "deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the\n",
      "room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which\n",
      "he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they\n",
      "derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main\n",
      "building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about\n",
      "that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did\n",
      "his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,\n",
      "was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages\n",
      "of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two\n",
      "great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the\n",
      "open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared\n",
      "to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,\n",
      "or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless\n",
      "objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had\n",
      "opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and\n",
      "he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came\n",
      "the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring\n",
      "in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible\n",
      "nature were going up to Heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank God,” said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, “that no one near and\n",
      "dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all\n",
      "who are in danger!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,\n",
      "“They have come back!” and sat listening. But, there was no loud\n",
      "irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate\n",
      "clash again, and all was quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague\n",
      "uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally\n",
      "awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to\n",
      "go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly\n",
      "opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in\n",
      "amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with\n",
      "that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it\n",
      "seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give\n",
      "force and power to it in this one passage of her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this?” cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. “What is the\n",
      "matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?\n",
      "What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted\n",
      "out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend! My husband!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your husband, Lucie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Charles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What of Charles?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Has been here some days--three or four--I don’t know how many--I can’t\n",
      "collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to\n",
      "us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the\n",
      "bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices\n",
      "came pouring into the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that noise?” said the Doctor, turning towards the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry. “Don’t look out! Manette, for your life,\n",
      "don’t touch the blind!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and\n",
      "said, with a cool, bold smile:\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been\n",
      "a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In\n",
      "France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would\n",
      "touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.\n",
      "My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the\n",
      "barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I\n",
      "knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I\n",
      "told Lucie so.--What is that noise?” His hand was again upon the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. “No, Lucie, my\n",
      "dear, nor you!” He got his arm round her, and held her. “Don’t be so\n",
      "terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm\n",
      "having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in\n",
      "this fatal place. What prison is he in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“La Force!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in\n",
      "your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to\n",
      "do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or\n",
      "I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;\n",
      "you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you\n",
      "to do for Charles’s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must\n",
      "instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a\n",
      "room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for\n",
      "two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not\n",
      "delay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do\n",
      "nothing else than this. I know you are true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the\n",
      "key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and\n",
      "partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor’s arm, and\n",
      "looked out with him into the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near\n",
      "enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The\n",
      "people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they\n",
      "had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up\n",
      "there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, such awful workers, and such awful work!\n",
      "\n",
      "The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two\n",
      "men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of\n",
      "the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than\n",
      "the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.\n",
      "False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their\n",
      "hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with\n",
      "howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of\n",
      "sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung\n",
      "forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women\n",
      "held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping\n",
      "blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks\n",
      "struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and\n",
      "fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from\n",
      "the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the\n",
      "sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all\n",
      "over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain\n",
      "upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women’s lace\n",
      "and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through\n",
      "and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be\n",
      "sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to\n",
      "the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments\n",
      "of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And\n",
      "as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream\n",
      "of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in\n",
      "their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have\n",
      "given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of\n",
      "any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it\n",
      "were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for\n",
      "explanation in his friend’s ashy face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are,” Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at\n",
      "the locked room, “murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you\n",
      "say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you\n",
      "have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It\n",
      "may be too late, I don’t know, but let it not be a minute later!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,\n",
      "and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.\n",
      "\n",
      "His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous\n",
      "confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,\n",
      "carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.\n",
      "For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and\n",
      "the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,\n",
      "surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all\n",
      "linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with\n",
      "cries of--“Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner’s\n",
      "kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save\n",
      "the prisoner Evrémonde at La Force!” and a thousand answering shouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window\n",
      "and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was\n",
      "assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found\n",
      "her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be\n",
      "surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat\n",
      "watching them in such quiet as the night knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,\n",
      "clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own\n",
      "bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty\n",
      "charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O\n",
      "the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the\n",
      "irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.\n",
      "“What is it?” cried Lucie, affrighted. “Hush! The soldiers’ swords are\n",
      "sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry. “The place is national property now,\n",
      "and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.\n",
      "Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself\n",
      "from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so\n",
      "besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back\n",
      "to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by\n",
      "the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.\n",
      "Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of\n",
      "the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,\n",
      "climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its\n",
      "dainty cushions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,\n",
      "and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood\n",
      "alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had\n",
      "never given, and would never take away.\n",

      "CHAPTER III.\n",
      "The Shadow\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.\n",
      "Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to\n",
      "imperil Tellson’s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under\n",
      "the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded\n",
      "for Lucie and her child, without a moment’s demur; but the great trust\n",
      "he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict\n",
      "man of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out\n",
      "the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to\n",
      "the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the\n",
      "same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the\n",
      "most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in\n",
      "its dangerous workings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute’s delay\n",
      "tending to compromise Tellson’s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said\n",
      "that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that\n",
      "Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to\n",
      "this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and\n",
      "he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry\n",
      "went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up\n",
      "in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows\n",
      "of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:\n",
      "giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.\n",
      "He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear\n",
      "considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.\n",
      "A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly\n",
      "and heavily the day lagged on with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He\n",
      "was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to\n",
      "do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a\n",
      "man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,\n",
      "addressed him by his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your servant,” said Mr. Lorry. “Do you know me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five\n",
      "to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of\n",
      "emphasis, the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have seen you somewhere.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“And what says he? What does he send me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the\n",

      "“Yes,” returned Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical\n",
      "way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the\n",
      "courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madame Defarge, surely!” said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly\n",
      "the same attitude some seventeen years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is she,” observed her husband.\n",

      "\n",
      "Beginning to be struck by Defarge’s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously\n",
      "at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being\n",
      "The Vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,\n",
      "ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,\n",
      "and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the\n",
      "tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that\n",
      "delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in\n",
      "the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "     “DEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has\n",

      "      Kiss our child for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received\n",
      "it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the\n",
      "hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly\n",
      "action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took\n",
      "to its knitting again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in\n",
      "the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her\n",
      "neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted\n",
      "eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent\n",
      "risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever\n",
      "trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power\n",
      "to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she\n",
      "may identify them. I believe,” said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his\n",
      "reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself\n",
      "upon him more and more, “I state the case, Citizen Defarge?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a\n",
      "gruff sound of acquiescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to\n",
      "propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our\n",
      "good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no\n",
      "French.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a\n",
      "match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,\n",
      "appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,\n",
      "whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope\n",
      "_you_ are pretty well!” She also bestowed a British cough on Madame\n",
      "Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the\n",
      "first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it\n",
      "were the finger of Fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner’s darling\n",

      "\n",
      "The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so\n",
      "threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively\n",
      "kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The\n",
      "shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,\n",
      "threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is enough, my husband,” said Madame Defarge. “I have seen them. We\n",
      "may go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and\n",
      "presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as\n",
      "she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge’s dress:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will\n",
      "help me to see him if you can?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge, looking\n",
      "down at her with perfect composure. “It is the daughter of your father\n",
      "who is my business here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child’s sake! She\n",
      "will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more\n",
      "afraid of you than of these others.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.\n",
      "Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,\n",
      "collected his face into a sterner expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it that your husband says in that little letter?” asked Madame\n",
      "Defarge, with a lowering smile. “Influence; he says something touching\n",
      "influence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That my father,” said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her\n",
      "breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has\n",
      "much influence around him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Surely it will release him!” said Madame Defarge. “Let it do so.”\n",

      "“As a wife and mother,” cried Lucie, most earnestly, “I implore you to\n",
      "have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against\n",
      "my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think\n",
      "of me. As a wife and mother!”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little\n",
      "as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have\n",
      "known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,\n",
      "often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in\n",
      "themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,\n",
      "sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have seen nothing else,” returned The Vengeance.\n",
      "\n",

      "again upon Lucie. “Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife\n",
      "and mother would be much to us now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge\n",
      "went last, and closed the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. “Courage,\n",

      "late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a\n",

      "\n",
      "“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Lorry; “what is this despondency in the brave\n",
      "little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his\n",
      "absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be\n",
      "kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that\n",
      "not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she\n",
      "know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all\n",
      "ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been\n",
      "darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been\n",
      "tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon\n",
      "the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that\n",
      "some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on\n",
      "which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a\n",
      "scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had\n",
      "found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were\n",
      "brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth\n",
      "to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back\n",
      "to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he\n",
      "had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen\n",
      "years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the\n",
      "body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this\n",
      "man was Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,\n",
      "that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard\n",
      "to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some\n",
      "dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life\n",
      "and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as\n",
      "a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded\n",
      "to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and\n",
      "examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when\n",
      "the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible\n",
      "to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,\n",
      "the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that\n",
      "the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held\n",
      "inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner\n",
      "was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the\n",
      "Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and\n",
      "assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,\n",
      "delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had\n",
      "often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and\n",
      "had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by\n",
      "intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were\n",
      "saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against\n",
      "those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had\n",
      "been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had\n",
      "thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress\n",
      "the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him\n",
      "in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies\n",
      "of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this\n",
      "awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man\n",
      "with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him\n",
      "carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged\n",
      "anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes\n",
      "with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of\n",
      "his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that\n",
      "such dread experiences would revive the old danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never\n",
      "at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor\n",
      "felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time\n",
      "he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which\n",
      "could break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him.\n",
      "“It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.\n",
      "As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be\n",
      "helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid\n",
      "of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw\n",
      "the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing\n",
      "of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a\n",
      "clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which\n",
      "had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would\n",
      "have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself\n",
      "in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees\n",
      "of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his\n",
      "personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician\n",
      "of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie\n",
      "that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the\n",
      "general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet\n",
      "messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself\n",
      "sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor’s hand), but she was\n",
      "not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of\n",
      "plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were\n",
      "known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new life of the Doctor’s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the\n",
      "sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.\n",
      "Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;\n",
      "but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that\n",
      "time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter\n",
      "and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.\n",
      "Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through\n",
      "that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles’s\n",
      "ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,\n",
      "that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to\n",
      "trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself\n",
      "and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and\n",
      "affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in\n",
      "rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. “All\n",
      "curious to see,” thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all\n",
      "natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it\n",
      "couldn’t be in better hands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get\n",
      "Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,\n",
      "the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new\n",
      "era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of\n",
      "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death\n",
      "against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the\n",
      "great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise\n",
      "against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils\n",
      "of France, as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast, and\n",
      "had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and\n",
      "alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of\n",
      "the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds\n",
      "and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the\n",
      "fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.\n",
      "What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year\n",
      "One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,\n",
      "and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no\n",
      "measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when\n",
      "time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other\n",
      "count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever\n",
      "of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the\n",
      "unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the\n",
      "head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the\n",
      "head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned\n",
      "widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in\n",
      "all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A\n",
      "revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand\n",
      "revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,\n",
      "which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over\n",
      "any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged\n",
      "with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;\n",
      "these things became the established order and nature of appointed\n",
      "things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.\n",
      "Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before\n",
      "the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the\n",
      "sharp female called La Guillotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,\n",
      "it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a\n",
      "peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which\n",
      "shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window\n",
      "and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the\n",
      "human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts\n",
      "from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and\n",
      "believed in where the Cross was denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,\n",
      "were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young\n",
      "Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed\n",
      "the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and\n",
      "good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one\n",
      "dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.\n",
      "The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief\n",
      "functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his\n",

      "current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time\n",
      "away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three\n",
      "months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more\n",
      "wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,\n",
      "that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the\n",
      "violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares\n",
      "under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the\n",
      "terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at\n",
      "that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable\n",
      "in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and\n",
      "victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the\n",
      "appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all\n",
      "other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if\n",

      "The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and\n",
      "they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music\n",

      "keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.\n",
      "Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced\n",
      "together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a\n",

      "advanced, retreated, struck at one another’s hands, clutched at one\n",
      "another’s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round\n",
      "in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest\n",

      "and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they\n",
      "all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then\n",
      "reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped\n",
      "again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width\n",
      "of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high\n",
      "up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible\n",
      "as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once\n",
      "innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into\n",
      "a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the\n",
      "heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how\n",
      "warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly\n",
      "bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child’s head thus distracted, the\n",

      "The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined\n",
      "Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were\n",
      "read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The\n",
      "standard gaoler-joke was, “Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you\n",
      "inside there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved\n",
      "for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles\n",
      "Evrémonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen\n",
      "hundreds pass away so.\n",
      "\n",
      "His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them\n",
      "to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the\n",
      "list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three\n",
      "names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so\n",
      "summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been\n",
      "guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber\n",
      "where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his\n",
      "arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human\n",
      "creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the\n",
      "scaffold.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was\n",
      "soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force\n",
      "were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little\n",
      "concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears\n",
      "there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be\n",
      "refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the\n",
      "common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs\n",
      "who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from\n",
      "insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the\n",
      "time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour\n",
      "or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to\n",
      "brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere\n",
      "boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In\n",
      "seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the\n",

      "\n",
      "The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its\n",

      "at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the\n",
      "usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the\n",
      "honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never\n",
      "without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing\n",
      "spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,\n",
      "anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,\n",
      "the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore\n",
      "knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many\n",
      "knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under\n",

      "he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly\n",
      "remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in\n",
      "his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed\n",
      "in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to\n",
      "himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to\n",
      "be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at\n",
      "the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,\n",
      "in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.\n",
      "Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who\n",

      "\n",
      "On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot\n",
      "according to Doctor Manette’s reiterated instructions. The same cautious\n",
      "counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every\n",
      "inch of his road.\n",

      "The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not\n",
      "sooner?\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means\n",
      "of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,\n",
      "he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.\n",
      "He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of\n",
      "a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his\n",
      "absence. He had come back, to save a citizen’s life, and to bear his\n",
      "testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal\n",
      "in the eyes of the Republic?\n",
      "\n",
      "The populace cried enthusiastically, “No!” and the President rang his\n",
      "bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry “No!”\n",
      " until they left off, of their own will.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained\n",
      "that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence\n",
      "to the citizen’s letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier,\n",
      "but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before\n",
      "the President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that\n",
      "it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced\n",
      "and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen\n",
      "Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the\n",
      "pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of\n",
      "enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly\n",
      "overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out\n",
      "of the Tribunal’s patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he\n",
      "had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury’s\n",
      "declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was\n",
      "answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evrémonde,\n",
      "called Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,\n",
      "and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he\n",
      "proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his\n",
      "release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in\n",
      "England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in\n",
      "their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat\n",
      "government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as\n",
      "the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these\n",
      "circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the\n",
      "straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the\n",
      "populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur\n",
      "Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,\n",
      "had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his\n",
      "account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that\n",
      "they were ready with their votes if the President were content to\n",
      "receive them.\n",
      "\n",
      "At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace\n",
      "set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner’s\n",
      "favour, and the President declared him free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace\n",
      "sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards\n",
      "generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against\n",
      "their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of\n",
      "these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,\n",
      "to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner\n",
      "was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood\n",
      "at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the\n",
      "prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after\n",
      "his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from\n",
      "exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same\n",
      "people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with\n",
      "the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the\n",
      "streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,\n",
      "rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried\n",
      "together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not\n",
      "assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate\n",
      "itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to\n",
      "him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four\n",
      "hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign\n",
      "of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, “Long live the\n",
      "Republic!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,\n",
      "for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great\n",
      "crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in\n",
      "Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the\n",
      "concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by\n",
      "turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of\n",
      "which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the\n",
      "shore.\n",

      "taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.\n",
      "Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they\n",
      "had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not\n",
      "even the Doctor’s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home\n",
      "on men’s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,\n",
      "and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that\n",
      "he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he\n",
      "was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing\n",
      "him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the\n",
      "prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as\n",
      "they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried\n",
      "him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father\n",
      "had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his\n",
      "feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his\n",
      "face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come\n",
      "together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the\n",
      "rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.\n",
      "Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the\n",
      "crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and\n",
      "overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river’s bank,\n",
      "and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled\n",
      "them away.\n",
      "\n",
      "After grasping the Doctor’s hand, as he stood victorious and proud\n",
      "before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in\n",
      "breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;\n",
      "after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round\n",

      "often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a\n",
      "vague but heavy fear was upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately\n",
      "revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on\n",
      "vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that\n",
      "many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to\n",
      "her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her\n",
      "heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.\n",
      "The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now\n",
      "the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued\n",
      "them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to\n",
      "his real presence and trembled more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this\n",
      "woman’s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,\n",
      "no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task\n",
      "he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let\n",

      "Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was\n",
      "the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but\n",
      "because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,\n",
      "had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards\n",
      "the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and\n",
      "partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and\n",
      "citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them\n",
      "occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by\n",
      "Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,\n",
      "Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every\n",
      "house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters\n",
      "of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.\n",
      "Jerry Cruncher’s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down\n",
      "below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name\n",
      "himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had\n",
      "employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evrémonde, called\n",
      "Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual\n",
      "harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor’s little household, as\n",
      "in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted\n",
      "were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small\n",
      "shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as\n",
      "possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the\n",
      "office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the\n",
      "basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were\n",
      "lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home\n",
      "such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long\n",
      "association with a French family, might have known as much of their\n",
      "language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that\n",
      "direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was\n",
      "pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing\n",
      "was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any\n",
      "introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be\n",
      "the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold\n",
      "of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always\n",
      "made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,\n",
      "one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;\n",
      "“if you are ready, I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross’s service. He had worn\n",
      "all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s all manner of things wanted,” said Miss Pross, “and we shall\n",
      "have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts\n",
      "these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,”\n",
      " retorted Jerry, “whether they drink your health or the Old Un’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’s he?” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning “Old\n",
      "Nick’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ha!” said Miss Pross, “it doesn’t need an interpreter to explain the\n",
      "meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it’s Midnight Murder,\n",
      "and Mischief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!” cried Lucie.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes, yes, I’ll be cautious,” said Miss Pross; “but I may say\n",
      "among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey\n",
      "smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the\n",
      "streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!\n",
      "Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don’t move your\n",
      "pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!\n",
      "May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you may take that liberty,” the Doctor answered, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For gracious sake, don’t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of\n",
      "that,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, dear! Again?” Lucie remonstrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, “the\n",
      "short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious\n",
      "Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; “and\n",
      "as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish\n",
      "tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words\n",

      "“I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you\n",

      "“But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there”--it was the good creature’s\n",
      "way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety\n",
      "with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--“is there any\n",
      "prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heigh-ho-hum!” said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she\n",
      "glanced at her darling’s golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we\n",
      "must have patience and wait: that’s all. We must hold up our heads and\n",
      "fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don’t\n",
      "you move, Ladybird!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the\n",
      "child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the\n",
      "Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in\n",
      "a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie\n",
      "sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,\n",
      "in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of\n",
      "a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out\n",
      "a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and\n",
      "quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” she cried, all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand\n",
      "on hers, “command yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The\n",
      "least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father’s daughter!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face\n",
      "and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My child,” said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her\n",
      "shoulder, “I _have_ saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go\n",
      "to the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,\n",
      "and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough\n",

      "Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her\n",
      "way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the\n",
      "Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases\n",
      "she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They\n",
      "both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they\n",
      "passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and\n",
      "turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It\n",
      "was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing\n",
      "lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were\n",
      "stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the\n",
      "Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got\n",
      "undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never\n",
      "grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil\n",
      "for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.\n",
      "After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the\n",
      "Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,\n",
      "once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather\n",
      "took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same\n",
      "description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was\n",
      "not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her\n",
      "opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,\n",
      "attended by her cavalier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,\n",
      "playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,\n",
      "bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of\n",
      "the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be\n",
      "resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the\n",
      "popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,\n",
      "like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached\n",
      "the counter, and showed what they wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a\n",
      "corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No\n",
      "sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped\n",
      "her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was\n",
      "assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the\n",
      "likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only\n",
      "saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all\n",
      "the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,\n",
      "evidently English.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the\n",
      "Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very\n",
      "voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss\n",
      "Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no\n",
      "ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that\n",
      "not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual\n",
      "account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?” said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;\n",
      "speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in\n",
      "English.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!” cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.\n",
      "“After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,\n",
      "do I find you here!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?” asked the\n",
      "man, in a furtive, frightened way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Brother, brother!” cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. “Have I ever\n",
      "been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said Solomon, “and come out, if you\n",
      "want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who’s this man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means\n",
      "affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr. Cruncher.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him come out too,” said Solomon. “Does he think me a ghost?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a\n",
      "word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule\n",
      "through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did\n",
      "so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus\n",
      "of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French\n",
      "language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and\n",
      "pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do you\n",
      "want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away\n",
      "from!” cried Miss Pross, “to give me such a greeting, and show me no\n",
      "affection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There. Confound it! There,” said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross’s\n",
      "lips with his own. “Now are you content?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother Solomon, “I am not\n",
      "surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If\n",
      "you really don’t want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you\n",
      "do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I\n",
      "am an official.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My English brother Solomon,” mourned Miss Pross, casting up her\n",
      "tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and\n",
      "greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and\n",
      "such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in\n",
      "his--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting. “I knew it. You want to be\n",
      "the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just\n",
      "as I am getting on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!” cried Miss Pross. “Far\n",
      "rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever\n",
      "loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,\n",
      "and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will\n",
      "detain you no longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any\n",
      "culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years\n",
      "ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent\n",
      "her money and left her!\n",
      "\n",
      "He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging\n",
      "condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative\n",
      "merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,\n",
      "all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,\n",
      "hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular\n",
      "question:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,\n",
      "or Solomon John?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not\n",
      "previously uttered a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said Mr. Cruncher. “Speak out, you know.” (Which, by the way,\n",
      "was more than he could do himself.) “John Solomon, or Solomon John? She\n",
      "calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know\n",
      "you’re John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that\n",
      "name of Pross, likewise. That warn’t your name over the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I don’t know all I mean, for I can’t call to mind what your name\n",
      "was, over the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. But I’ll swear it was a name of two syllables.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. T’other one’s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness\n",
      "at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to\n",
      "yourself, was you called at that time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad,” said another voice, striking in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the name for a thousand pound!” cried Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind\n",
      "him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher’s\n",
      "elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry’s, to his\n",
      "surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself\n",
      "elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present\n",
      "myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a\n",
      "better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad\n",
      "was not a Sheep of the Prisons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,\n",
      "who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you,” said Sydney. “I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out\n",
      "of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,\n",
      "an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember\n",
      "faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having\n",
      "a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with\n",
      "the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your\n",
      "direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and\n",
      "sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved\n",
      "conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the\n",
      "nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed\n",
      "to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What purpose?” the spy asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the\n",
      "street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your\n",
      "company--at the office of Tellson’s Bank, for instance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Under a threat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Did I say that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, why should I go there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, Mr. Barsad, I can’t say, if you can’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean that you won’t say, sir?” the spy irresolutely asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton’s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his\n",
      "quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,\n",
      "and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and\n",
      "made the most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his\n",
      "sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it’s your doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come, Mr. Barsad!” exclaimed Sydney. “Don’t be ungrateful.\n",
      "But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so\n",
      "pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual\n",
      "satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I’ll go with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her\n",
      "own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,\n",
      "at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort\n",
      "knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry’s with us. Are we\n",
      "ready? Come then!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life\n",
      "remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney’s arm and looked up\n",
      "in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced\n",
      "purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only\n",
      "contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was\n",
      "too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved\n",
      "her affection, and with Sydney’s friendly reassurances, adequately to\n",
      "heed what she observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.\n",
      "Lorry’s, which was within a few minutes’ walk. John Barsad, or Solomon\n",
      "Pross, walked at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery\n",
      "little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the\n",
      "picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson’s, who had looked\n",
      "into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years\n",
      "ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with\n",
      "which he saw a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Pross’s brother, sir,” said Sydney. “Mr. Barsad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad?” repeated the old gentleman, “Barsad? I have an association\n",
      "with the name--and with the face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton,\n",
      "coolly. “Pray sit down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,\n",
      "by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr. Lorry\n",
      "immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised\n",
      "look of abhorrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate\n",
      "brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the\n",
      "relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do you\n",
      "tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about\n",
      "to return to him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just now, if at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,” said Sydney, “and I\n",
      "have it from Mr. Barsad’s communication to a friend and brother Sheep\n",
      "over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the\n",
      "messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no\n",
      "earthly doubt that he is retaken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s business eye read in the speaker’s face that it was loss\n",
      "of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something\n",
      "might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was\n",
      "silently attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I trust,” said Sydney to him, “that the name and influence of\n",
      "Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he\n",
      "would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; I believe so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own\n",
      "to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette’s not having had the\n",
      "power to prevent this arrest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He may not have known of it beforehand,” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how\n",
      "identified he is with his son-in-law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his\n",
      "chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In short,” said Sydney, “this is a desperate time, when desperate games\n",
      "are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I\n",
      "will play the losing one. No man’s life here is worth purchase. Any one\n",
      "carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the\n",
      "stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend\n",
      "in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.\n",
      "Barsad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll run them over. I’ll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a\n",
      "brute I am; I wish you’d give me a little brandy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another\n",
      "glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking\n",
      "over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican\n",
      "committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,\n",
      "so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman\n",
      "is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a\n",
      "Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.\n",
      "That’s a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican\n",
      "French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic\n",
      "English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That’s an excellent\n",
      "card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.\n",
      "Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the\n",
      "spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,\n",
      "the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so\n",
      "difficult to find. That’s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my\n",
      "hand, Mr. Barsad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section\n",
      "Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don’t\n",
      "hurry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and\n",
      "drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself\n",
      "into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he\n",
      "poured out and drank another glassful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards\n",
      "in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable\n",
      "employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing\n",
      "there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for\n",
      "vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern\n",
      "date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in\n",
      "France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen\n",
      "there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He\n",
      "knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint\n",
      "Antoine and Defarge’s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police\n",
      "such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette’s imprisonment,\n",
      "release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to\n",
      "familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame\n",
      "Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered\n",

      "He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over\n",
      "again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the\n",
      "guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as\n",
      "he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that\n",
      "he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of\n",
      "his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning\n",
      "terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such\n",
      "grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw\n",
      "that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many\n",
      "proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash\n",
      "his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon\n",
      "terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify\n",

      "put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can\n",
      "under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace\n",
      "of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is\n",
      "considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by\n",
      "somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean\n",
      "himself as to make himself one?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,” said Carton, taking the answer on himself,\n",

      "received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a\n",
      "mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and\n",
      "failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air\n",
      "of contemplating cards:\n",
      "\n",
      "“And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I\n",
      "have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and\n",

      "who was he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“French. You don’t know him,” said the spy, quickly.\n",
      "\n",

      "at all, though he echoed his word. “Well; he may be.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Provincial,” said the spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Foreign!” cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a\n",
      "light broke clearly on his mind. “Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We\n",
      "had that man before us at the Old Bailey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, there you are hasty, sir,” said Barsad, with a smile that gave his\n",
      "aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; “there you really give\n",
      "me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this\n",
      "distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I\n",
      "attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church\n",
      "of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard\n",

      "to lay him in his coffin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable\n",

      "risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher’s head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us be reasonable,” said the spy, “and let us be fair. To show you\n",

      "lay before you a certificate of Cly’s burial, which I happened to have\n",
      "carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and opened\n",
      "it, “ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take\n",
      "it in your hand; it’s no forgery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more\n",
      "violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the\n",
      "crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on\n",
      "the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.\n",

      "I’ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at\n",

      "explain himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is\n",

      "wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,\n",
      "in so much as a word of one syllable, and I’ll either catch hold of his\n",

      "quite a liberal offer; “or I’ll out and announce him.”\n",

      "you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another\n",

      "the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!\n",

      "card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” returned the spy. “I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular\n",
      "with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk\n",
      "of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that\n",
      "he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this\n",
      "man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.”\n",

      "Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my\n",
      "office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my\n",
      "life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,\n",
      "I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate\n",

      "at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman’s\n",
      "manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the\n",
      "leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,\n",
      "and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very\n",
      "questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry’s eye caught\n",
      "his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the\n",
      "hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an\n",

      "\n",
      "“What have you been, besides a messenger?”\n",
      "\n",
      "After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agicultooral\n",
      "character.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mind misgives me much,” said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger\n",
      "at him, “that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson’s\n",
      "as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous\n",
      "description. If you have, don’t expect me to befriend you when you\n",
      "get back to England. If you have, don’t expect me to keep your secret.\n",
      "Tellson’s shall not be imposed upon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman like\n",
      "yourself wot I’ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I’m grey at it,\n",
      "would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don’t say it\n",
      "is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if\n",
      "it wos, it wouldn’t, even then, be all o’ one side. There’d be two sides\n",
      "to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking\n",
      "up their guineas where a honest tradesman don’t pick up his\n",
      "fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor\n",
      "yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson’s, and a cocking\n",
      "their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going\n",
      "out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.\n",
      "Well, that ’ud be imposing, too, on Tellson’s. For you cannot sarse the\n",
      "goose and not the gander. And here’s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos\n",
      "in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,\n",
      "a floppin’ again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark\n",
      "ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors’ wives don’t flop--catch ’em at\n",
      "it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,\n",
      "and how can you rightly have one without t’other? Then, wot with\n",
      "undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot\n",
      "with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn’t get\n",
      "much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never\n",

      "“Don’t prevaricate,” said Mr. Lorry.\n",

      "further from his thoughts or practice--“which I don’t say it is--wot I\n",
      "would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at\n",

      "your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it\n",
      "wos so, which I still don’t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to\n",
      "you, sir), let that there boy keep his father’s place, and take care of\n",
      "his mother; don’t blow upon that boy’s father--do not do it, sir--and\n",
      "let that father go into the line of the reg’lar diggin’, and make amends\n",
      "for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin’ of ’em in with\n",
      "a will, and with conwictions respectin’ the futur’ keepin’ of ’em safe.\n",
      "That, Mr. Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his\n",
      "arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his\n",
      "discourse, “is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don’t\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy\n",
      "returned from the dark room. “Adieu, Mr. Barsad,” said the former; “our\n",
      "arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they\n",
      "were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s countenance fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is all I could do,” said Carton. “To propose too much, would be\n",
      "to put this man’s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing\n",
      "worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the\n",
      "weakness of the position. There is no help for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But access to him,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it should go ill before the\n",

      "Mr. Lorry’s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his\n",
      "darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually\n",
      "weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,\n",
      "and his tears fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered\n",
      "voice. “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my\n",
      "father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your\n",
      "sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,\n",

      "Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there\n",
      "was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,\n",
      "that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly\n",
      "unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To return to poor Darnay,” said Carton. “Don’t tell Her of this\n",

      "to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to\n",
      "see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and\n",
      "evidently understood it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them would\n",
      "only add to her trouble. Don’t speak of me to her. As I said to you when\n",
      "I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any\n",
      "little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.\n",
      "You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going now, directly.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It\n",

      "fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),\n",
      "passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a\n",
      "wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little\n",
      "flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat\n",
      "and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their\n",
      "light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,\n",
      "all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was\n",
      "sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;\n",

      "broken under the weight of his foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgot it,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the\n",

      "the expression of prisoners’ faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly\n",
      "reminded of that expression.\n",

      "“And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?” said Carton, turning\n",
      "to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so\n",
      "unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to\n",
      "have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have\n",
      "my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.”\n",

      "“You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;\n",
      "trusted, respected, and looked up to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I\n",
      "may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”\n",

      "“See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss\n",
      "you when you leave it empty!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A solitary old bachelor,” answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. “There\n",

      "\n",
      "“You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a\n",
      "few moments, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the\n",
      "days when you sat at your mother’s knee, seem days of very long ago?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw\n",
      "closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and\n",
      "nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and\n",
      "preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances\n",
      "that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),\n",
      "and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not\n",
      "so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand the feeling!” exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. “And\n",
      "you are the better for it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with\n",
      "his outer coat; “But you,” said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, “you\n",
      "are young.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Carton. “I am not old, but my young way was never the way to\n",
      "age. Enough of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And of me, I am sure,” said Mr. Lorry. “Are you going out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless\n",
      "habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don’t be\n",
      "uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, unhappily.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a\n",
      "place for me. Take my arm, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A\n",
      "few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry’s destination. Carton left him\n",
      "there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate\n",
      "again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to\n",
      "the prison every day. “She came out here,” he said, looking about him,\n",
      "“turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in\n",
      "her steps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was ten o’clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,\n",
      "where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having\n",
      "closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night, citizen,” said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the\n",
      "man eyed him inquisitively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night, citizen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How goes the Republic?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount\n",
      "to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being\n",
      "exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you often go to see him--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,\n",
      "citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less\n",
      "than two pipes. Word of honour!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain\n",
      "how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire\n",
      "to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear\n",
      "English dress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You speak like a Frenchman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am an old student here.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Good night, citizen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after\n",
      "him. “And take a pipe with you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of\n",
      "the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap\n",
      "of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered\n",
      "the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,\n",
      "for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of\n",
      "terror--he stopped at a chemist’s shop, which the owner was closing with\n",
      "his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill\n",
      "thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his\n",
      "counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. “Whew!” the chemist\n",
      "whistled softly, as he read it. “Hi! hi! hi!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“For you, citizen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the\n",
      "consequences of mixing them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perfectly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by\n",
      "one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,\n",
      "and deliberately left the shop. “There is nothing more to do,” said he,\n",
      "glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. I can’t sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words\n",
      "aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of\n",
      "negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who\n",
      "had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into\n",
      "his road and saw its end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a\n",
      "youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His\n",
      "mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been\n",
      "read at his father’s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark\n",
      "streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing\n",
      "on high above him. “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:\n",
      "he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and\n",
      "whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow\n",
      "rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,\n",
      "and for to-morrow’s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,\n",
      "and still of to-morrow’s and to-morrow’s, the chain of association that\n",
      "brought the words home, like a rusty old ship’s anchor from the deep,\n",
      "might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and\n",
      "went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were\n",
      "going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors\n",
      "surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers\n",
      "were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length\n",
      "of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and\n",
      "profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon\n",
      "the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets\n",
      "along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and\n",
      "material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among\n",
      "the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn\n",
      "interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its\n",
      "short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for\n",
      "the lighter streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be\n",
      "suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy\n",
      "shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the\n",
      "people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At\n",
      "one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking\n",
      "for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over,\n",
      "and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth\n",
      "in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and\n",
      "believeth in me, shall never die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words\n",
      "were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm\n",
      "and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he\n",
      "heard them always.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the\n",
      "water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the\n",
      "picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light\n",
      "of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the\n",
      "sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,\n",
      "and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to\n",
      "Death’s dominion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden\n",
      "of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.\n",
      "And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light\n",
      "appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river\n",
      "sparkled under it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial\n",
      "friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the\n",
      "houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the\n",
      "bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little\n",
      "longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the\n",
      "stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--“Like me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then\n",
      "glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track\n",
      "in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart\n",
      "for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,\n",
      "ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise\n",
      "where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a\n",
      "little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh\n",
      "himself, went out to the place of trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell\n",
      "away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.\n",
      "Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there,\n",
      "sitting beside her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so\n",
      "sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying\n",
      "tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy\n",
      "blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If\n",
      "there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney\n",
      "Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,\n",
      "ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have\n",
      "been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not\n",
      "first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the\n",
      "Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good\n",
      "republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day\n",
      "after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and\n",
      "his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance\n",
      "gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,\n",
      "cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.\n",
      "Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.\n",
      "No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,\n",
      "murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye\n",
      "in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one\n",

      "afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful\n",
      "cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write\n",
      "it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it\n",
      "in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a\n",
      "place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I\n",
      "and my sorrows are dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with\n",
      "difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed\n",
      "with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope\n",
      "has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have\n",
      "noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I\n",
      "solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right\n",
      "mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the\n",
      "truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they\n",

      "“One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the\n",
      "twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired\n",
      "part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air,\n",
      "at an hour’s distance from my place of residence in the Street of the\n",
      "School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very\n",
      "fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it\n",
      "might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a\n",
      "voice called to the driver to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,\n",
      "and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage\n",
      "was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the\n",
      "door and alight before I came up with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to\n",
      "conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,\n",
      "I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather\n",
      "younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,\n",
      "and (as far as I could see) face too.\n",

      "has made a rising reputation in Paris?’\n",

      "so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were\n",
      "probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of\n",
      "overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words\n",
      "were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.\n",
      "They were armed. I was not.\n",
      "\n",

      "Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards\n",
      "when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently\n",
      "stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by\n",
      "a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had\n",
      "overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in\n",
      "answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck\n",

      "\n",

      "for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the\n",
      "other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner\n",
      "with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly\n",
      "alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found\n",

      "relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was\n",
      "conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we\n",
      "ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,\n",
      "lying on a bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much\n",
      "past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to\n",
      "her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were\n",
      "all portions of a gentleman’s dress. On one of them, which was a fringed\n",
      "scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble,\n",
      "and the letter E.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient;\n",

      "edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was\n",
      "in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve\n",
      "her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the\n",
      "corner caught my sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her\n",
      "and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and\n",
      "wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the\n",
      "words, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ and then counted up to\n",
      "twelve, and said, ‘Hush!’ For an instant, and no more, she would pause\n",
      "to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she\n",
      "would repeat the cry, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ and\n",
      "would count up to twelve, and say, ‘Hush!’ There was no variation in the\n",
      "order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment’s\n",
      "pause, in the utterance of these sounds.\n",

      "\n",
      "“The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, ‘There is\n",

      "\n",
      "“I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my\n",

      "more.\n",
      "\n",

      "efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it\n",
      "after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then\n",
      "sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman\n",
      "in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into\n",
      "a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently\n",
      "furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick\n",
      "old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the\n",
      "sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular\n",
      "succession, with the cry, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ the\n",
      "counting up to twelve, and ‘Hush!’ The frenzy was so violent, that I had\n",
      "not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to\n",
      "them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement\n",
      "in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer’s breast had this much\n",
      "soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the\n",
      "figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more\n",
      "regular.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by\n",
      "the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,\n",

      "\n",
      "“‘There is another patient.’\n",

      "to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and\n",
      "there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of\n",
      "the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to\n",
      "pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial\n",
      "and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in\n",

      "without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder\n",
      "brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was\n",

      "have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would\n",
      "have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his\n",

      "“Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few\n",
      "and short, but try.”\n",

      "Tellson’s banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face. “Shall I\n",
      "do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that\n",
      "these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound\n",

      "Let me think it out!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a\n",
      "turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought\n",
      "in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was\n",
      "confirmed. “It is best,” he said, finally resolved, “that these people\n",
      "should know there is such a man as I here.” And he turned his face\n",
      "towards Saint Antoine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in\n",
      "the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city\n",
      "well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained\n",
      "its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined\n",
      "at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the\n",
      "first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he\n",
      "had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had\n",
      "dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry’s hearth like a man who had\n",
      "done with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as late as seven o’clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out\n",
      "into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he\n",
      "stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered\n",
      "the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and\n",
      "his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge’s, and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the\n",
      "restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon\n",
      "the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the\n",
      "Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like\n",
      "a regular member of the establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent\n",
      "French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless\n",
      "glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced\n",
      "to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He repeated what he had already said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“English?” asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark\n",
      "eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were\n",
      "slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign\n",
      "accent. “Yes, madame, yes. I am English!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he\n",
      "took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its\n",
      "meaning, he heard her say, “I swear to you, like Evrémonde!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.\n",

      "“How?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good evening.”\n",
      "\n",

      "drink to the Republic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge went back to the counter, and said, “Certainly, a little like.”\n",
      " Madame sternly retorted, “I tell you a good deal like.” Jacques Three\n",
      "pacifically remarked, “He is so much in your mind, see you, madame.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow\n",
      "forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning\n",
      "their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence\n",
      "of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without\n",
      "disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed\n",
      "their conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is true what madame says,” observed Jacques Three. “Why stop? There\n",
      "is great force in that. Why stop?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well,” reasoned Defarge, “but one must stop somewhere. After all,\n",
      "the question is still where?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At extermination,” said madame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Magnificent!” croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly\n",
      "approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,” said Defarge, rather\n",
      "troubled; “in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has\n",
      "suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when\n",
      "the paper was read.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have observed his face!” repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.\n",
      "“Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the\n",
      "face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you have observed, my wife,” said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,\n",
      "“the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have observed his daughter,” repeated madame; “yes, I have observed\n",
      "his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I\n",
      "have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and\n",
      "I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my\n",
      "finger--!” She seemed to raise it (the listener’s eyes were always on\n",
      "his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as\n",
      "if the axe had dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The citizeness is superb!” croaked the Juryman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is an Angel!” said The Vengeance, and embraced her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, “if it\n",
      "depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this\n",
      "man even now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” protested Defarge. “Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I\n",
      "would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“See you then, Jacques,” said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; “and see you,\n",
      "too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as\n",
      "tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,\n",
      "doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so,” assented Defarge, without being asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds\n",
      "this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the\n",
      "night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,\n",
      "by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so,” assented Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is\n",
      "burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between\n",
      "those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is\n",
      "that so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so,” assented Defarge again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two\n",
      "hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, ‘Defarge, I was brought up\n",
      "among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured\n",
      "by the two Evrémonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my\n",
      "family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground\n",
      "was my sister, that husband was my sister’s husband, that unborn child\n",
      "was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,\n",
      "those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things\n",
      "descends to me!’ Ask him, is that so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so,” assented Defarge once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,” returned madame; “but don’t\n",
      "tell me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature\n",
      "of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing\n",
      "her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed\n",
      "a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but\n",
      "only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. “Tell\n",
      "the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer\n",
      "paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as\n",
      "a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge\n",
      "took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.\n",
      "The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might\n",
      "be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and\n",
      "deep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the\n",
      "prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present\n",
      "himself in Mr. Lorry’s room again, where he found the old gentleman\n",
      "walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie\n",
      "until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and\n",
      "keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the\n",
      "banking-house towards four o’clock. She had some faint hopes that his\n",
      "mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been\n",
      "more than five hours gone: where could he be?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and\n",
      "he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he\n",
      "should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.\n",
      "In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette\n",
      "did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and\n",
      "brought none. Where could he be?\n",
      "\n",
      "They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some\n",
      "weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on\n",
      "the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that\n",
      "time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at\n",
      "them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it. Where is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look\n",
      "straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I\n",
      "can’t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must\n",
      "finish those shoes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get to\n",
      "work. Give me my work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the\n",
      "ground, like a distracted child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a dreadful\n",
      "cry; “but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are\n",
      "not done to-night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lost, utterly lost!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,\n",
      "that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and\n",
      "soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should\n",
      "have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the\n",
      "embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret\n",
      "time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into\n",
      "the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle\n",
      "of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely\n",
      "daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both\n",
      "too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with\n",
      "one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken\n",
      "to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to\n",
      "me? Don’t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and\n",
      "exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not doubt it,” answered Mr. Lorry. “Say on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously\n",
      "rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as\n",
      "they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his\n",
      "feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to\n",
      "carry the lists of his day’s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton\n",
      "took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. “We should look\n",
      "at this!” he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and\n",
      "exclaimed, “Thank _God!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,” he put his hand in\n",
      "his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which\n",
      "enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton,\n",
      "an Englishman?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you\n",
      "remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor\n",
      "Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him\n",
      "and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the\n",
      "frontier! You see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,\n",
      "yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don’t stay to look; put it\n",
      "up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until\n",
      "within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is\n",

      "woman’s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong\n",
      "colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He\n",
      "confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,\n",
      "is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by\n",
      "Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her”--he never mentioned Lucie’s\n",
      "name--“making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that\n",
      "the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will\n",

      "\n",

      "on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place\n",
      "until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards;\n",
      "more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to\n",
      "mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her\n",
      "father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the\n",

      "to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless\n",

      "intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally\n",
      "without distinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no\n",
      "flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line\n",
      "of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had\n",
      "fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,\n",
      "that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could\n",
      "avail him nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh\n",
      "before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life\n",
      "was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts\n",
      "and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and\n",
      "when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,\n",
      "this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,\n",
      "a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against\n",
      "resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and\n",
      "child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a\n",
      "selfish thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there\n",
      "was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same\n",
      "road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate\n",
      "him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind\n",
      "enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So,\n",
      "by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his\n",
      "thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had\n",
      "travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means\n",
      "of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the\n",
      "prison lamps should be extinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing\n",
      "of her father’s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,\n",
      "and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father’s and uncle’s\n",
      "responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had\n",
      "already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name\n",
      "he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that\n",
      "her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he\n",
      "had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,\n",
      "for her father’s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had\n",
      "become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled\n",
      "to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on\n",
      "that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had\n",
      "preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that\n",
      "he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no\n",
      "mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had\n",
      "discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He\n",
      "besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console\n",
      "her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think\n",
      "of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly\n",
      "reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint\n",
      "sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and\n",
      "blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their\n",
      "dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her\n",
      "father.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her\n",
      "father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And\n",
      "he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any\n",
      "despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be\n",
      "tending.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.\n",
      "That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm\n",
      "attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so\n",
      "full of the others, that he never once thought of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When\n",
      "he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining\n",
      "forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had\n",
      "nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of\n",
      "heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and\n",
      "he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even\n",
      "suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there\n",
      "was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the\n",
      "sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it\n",
      "flashed upon his mind, “this is the day of my death!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads\n",
      "were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could\n",
      "meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking\n",
      "thoughts, which was very difficult to master.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How\n",
      "high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be\n",
      "stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed\n",
      "red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,\n",
      "or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise\n",
      "directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless\n",
      "times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no\n",
      "fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what\n",
      "to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the\n",
      "few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like\n",
      "the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the\n",
      "numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for\n",
      "ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard\n",
      "contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed\n",
      "him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly\n",
      "repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over.\n",
      "He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for\n",
      "himself and for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve gone for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would\n",
      "be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily\n",
      "and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two\n",

      "as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: “He has never seen\n",

      "no time!”\n",
      "\n",

      "hand, and it was his real grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?” he said.\n",
      "\n",

      "with a reproachful look, but Carton’s hand was close and firm at his\n",

      "seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his\n",

      "suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,\n",
      "footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry\n",
      "made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he\n",

      "\n",
      "Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then\n",
      "began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and\n",
      "finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely\n",
      "saying, “Follow me, Evrémonde!” and he followed into a large dark room,\n",
      "at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows\n",
      "within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern\n",
      "the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were\n",
      "standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;\n",
      "but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking\n",

      "As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two\n",

      "as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of\n",
      "discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young\n",
      "woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was\n",
      "no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from\n",

      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment\n",

      "\n",

      "“In a word,” Madame Defarge went on, “my husband has not my reason for\n",
      "pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for\n",
      "regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,\n",

      "to-day executed.--You?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in\n",
      "the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent\n",
      "of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of\n",
      "Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of\n",
      "smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national\n",
      "barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been\n",
      "suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at\n",
      "him out of Madame Defarge’s head) of having his small individual fears\n",
      "for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.\n",
      "\n",

      "over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we\n",
      "will give information against these people at my Section.”\n",
      "\n",

      "hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.\n",

      "determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart\n",
      "to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an\n",
      "instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have\n",
      "heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood\n",
      "with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,\n",
      "opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without\n",
      "pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of\n",
      "his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that\n",
      "his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was\n",
      "insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and\n",
      "her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made\n",
      "hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had\n",
      "been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which\n",
      "she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had\n",
      "been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any\n",
      "softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who\n",
      "sent her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly\n",
      "worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her\n",
      "dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her\n",
      "bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened\n",
      "dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such\n",
      "a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually\n",
      "walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown\n",
      "sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment\n",
      "waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,\n",
      "the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,\n",
      "but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining\n",
      "it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their\n",
      "escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.\n",
      "Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross\n",
      "and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at\n",
      "three o’clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.\n",
      "Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,\n",
      "passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in\n",
      "advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours\n",
      "of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that\n",
      "pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had\n",
      "beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had\n",
      "passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding\n",
      "their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,\n",
      "taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the\n",
      "else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose agitation\n",
      "was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:\n",
      "“what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another\n",
      "carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken\n",
      "suspicion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My opinion, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “is as you’re right. Likewise\n",
      "wot I’ll stand by you, right or wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,” said\n",
      "Miss Pross, wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are\n",
      "_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Respectin’ a future spear o’ life, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “I\n",
      "hope so. Respectin’ any present use o’ this here blessed old head o’\n",
      "mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o’\n",
      "two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here\n",
      "crisis?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, for gracious sake!” cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, “record\n",
      "them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“First,” said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with\n",
      "an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o’ this, never no\n",
      "more will I do it, never no more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,” returned Miss Pross, “that you\n",
      "never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it\n",
      "necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, miss,” returned Jerry, “it shall not be named to you. Second: them\n",
      "poor things well out o’ this, and never no more will I interfere with\n",
      "Mrs. Cruncher’s flopping, never no more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss Pross,\n",
      "striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt it\n",
      "is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own\n",
      "superintendence.--O my poor darlings!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a\n",
      "most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--“and let my words\n",
      "be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my\n",
      "opinions respectin’ flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only\n",
      "hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present\n",
      "time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted\n",
      "Miss Pross, “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forbid it,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,\n",
      "additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold\n",
      "out, “as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my\n",
      "earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn’t all\n",
      "flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get ’em out o’ this here dismal\n",
      "risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!” This was Mr. Cruncher’s\n",
      "conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.\n",
      "\n",
      "And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came\n",
      "nearer and nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we ever get back to our native land,” said Miss Pross, “you may rely\n",
      "upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and\n",
      "understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events\n",
      "you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in\n",
      "earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.\n",
      "Cruncher, let us think!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer\n",
      "and nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you were to go before,” said Miss Pross, “and stop the vehicle and\n",
      "horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn’t\n",
      "that be best?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where could you wait for me?” asked Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but\n",
      "Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame\n",
      "Defarge was drawing very near indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the cathedral door,” said Miss Pross. “Would it be much out of\n",
      "the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two\n",
      "towers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, like the best of men,” said Miss Pross, “go to the posting-house\n",
      "straight, and make that change.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am doubtful,” said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,\n",
      "“about leaving of you, you see. We don’t know what may happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heaven knows we don’t,” returned Miss Pross, “but have no fear for me.\n",
      "Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o’Clock, or as near it as you can,\n",
      "and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain\n",
      "of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives\n",
      "that may depend on both of us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This exordium, and Miss Pross’s two hands in quite agonised entreaty\n",
      "clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he\n",
      "immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself\n",
      "to follow as she had proposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The having originated a precaution which was already in course of\n",
      "execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing\n",
      "her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the\n",
      "streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty\n",
      "minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted\n",
      "rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door\n",
      "in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,\n",
      "which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she\n",
      "could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the\n",
      "dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there\n",
      "was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried\n",
      "out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of\n",
      "Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,\n",
      "those feet had come to meet that water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of Evrémonde;\n",
      "where is she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It flashed upon Miss Pross’s mind that the doors were all standing open,\n",
      "and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were\n",
      "four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before\n",
      "the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge’s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,\n",
      "and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful\n",
      "about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,\n",
      "of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different\n",
      "way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,” said Miss\n",
      "Pross, in her breathing. “Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of\n",
      "me. I am an Englishwoman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of\n",
      "Miss Pross’s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,\n",
      "hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a\n",
      "woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that\n",
      "Miss Pross was the family’s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well\n",
      "that Madame Defarge was the family’s malevolent enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On my way yonder,” said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of\n",
      "her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair and my\n",
      "knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I\n",
      "wish to see her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that your intentions are evil,” said Miss Pross, “and you may\n",
      "depend upon it, I’ll hold my own against them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other’s words;\n",
      "both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what\n",
      "the unintelligible words meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this\n",
      "moment,” said Madame Defarge. “Good patriots will know what that means.\n",
      "Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross, “and I\n",
      "was an English four-poster, they shouldn’t loose a splinter of me. No,\n",
      "you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in\n",
      "detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set\n",
      "at naught.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said Madame Defarge, frowning. “I take no\n",
      "answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand\n",
      "to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!”\n",
      " This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I little thought,” said Miss Pross, “that I should ever want to\n",
      "understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,\n",
      "except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any\n",
      "part of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of them for a single moment released the other’s eyes. Madame\n",
      "Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross\n",
      "first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a Briton,” said Miss Pross, “I am desperate. I don’t care an\n",
      "English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the\n",
      "greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I’ll not leave a handful of that\n",
      "dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes\n",
      "between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.\n",
      "Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the\n",
      "irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame\n",
      "Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. “Ha, ha!” she\n",
      "laughed, “you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that\n",
      "Doctor.” Then she raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor! Wife\n",
      "of Evrémonde! Child of Evrémonde! Any person but this miserable fool,\n",
      "answer the Citizeness Defarge!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the\n",
      "expression of Miss Pross’s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from\n",
      "either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.\n",
      "Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there\n",
      "are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind\n",
      "you! Let me look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never!” said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as\n",
      "Madame Defarge understood the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and\n",
      "brought back,” said Madame Defarge to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As long as you don’t know whether they are in that room or not, you are\n",
      "uncertain what to do,” said Miss Pross to herself; “and you shall not\n",
      "know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know\n",
      "that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,\n",
      "I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said\n",
      "Madame Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are\n",
      "not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,\n",
      "while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to\n",
      "my darling,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the\n",
      "moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.\n",
      "It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,\n",
      "with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,\n",
      "clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle\n",
      "that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her\n",
      "face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and\n",
      "clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, Madame Defarge’s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled\n",
      "waist. “It is under my arm,” said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, “you\n",
      "shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold\n",
      "you till one or other of us faints or dies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge’s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw\n",
      "what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood\n",
      "alone--blinded with smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful\n",
      "stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman\n",
      "whose body lay lifeless on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the\n",
      "body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for\n",
      "fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of\n",
      "what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to\n",
      "go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to\n",
      "get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on,\n",
      "out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking\n",
      "away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe\n",
      "and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.\n",
      "\n",
      "By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have\n",
      "gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she\n",
      "was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement\n",
      "like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of\n",
      "gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her\n",
      "dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a\n",
      "hundred ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving\n",
      "at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,\n",
      "she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if\n",
      "it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains\n",
      "discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and\n",
      "charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the\n",
      "escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The usual noises,” Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the\n",
      "question and by her aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t hear you,” said Miss Pross. “What do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could\n",
      "not hear him. “So I’ll nod my head,” thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, “at\n",
      "all events she’ll see that.” And she did.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there any noise in the streets now?” asked Miss Pross again,\n",
      "presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t hear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gone deaf in an hour?” said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind\n",
      "much disturbed; “wot’s come to her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel,” said Miss Pross, “as if there had been a flash and a crash,\n",
      "and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blest if she ain’t in a queer condition!” said Mr. Cruncher, more and\n",
      "more disturbed. “Wot can she have been a takin’, to keep her courage up?\n",
      "Hark! There’s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?”\n",

      "conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush\n",

      "No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order\n",
      "of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. “If thou be changed\n",
      "into this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in\n",
      "the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so! But, if thou wear this\n",

      "As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up\n",
      "a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces\n",
      "are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.\n",
      "So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that\n",
      "in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the\n",
      "hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in\n",
      "the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;\n",
      "then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a\n",
      "curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to\n",
      "tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all\n",
      "things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with\n",
      "a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with\n",
      "drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so\n",
      "heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as\n",
      "they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,\n",
      "and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and\n",
      "he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made\n",
      "drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole\n",

      "There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,\n",

      "always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The\n",
      "horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with\n",
      "their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands\n",
      "at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a\n",
      "mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has\n",
      "no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the\n",
      "girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised\n",
      "against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he\n",

      "touch his face, his arms being bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands\n",
      "the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there.\n",
      "He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, “Has he\n",

      "close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following\n",
      "to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of\n",
      "public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the\n",

      "lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread\n",

      "enough to find her!\n",

      "she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for\n",
      "her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils\n",

      "still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the\n",

      "\n",
      "      “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\n",

      "      say by his account as well as his sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no\n",
      "      means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very\n",

      "\n",
      "      “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\n",

      "\n",
      "      “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\n",
      "      heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it\n",

      "\n",
      "      “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth\n",

      "      my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I\n",
      "      look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\n",

      "      charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from\n",

      "      singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing\n",

      "      endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;\n",
      "      Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting\n",
      "      was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes\n",
      "      were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched\n",
      "      her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which\n",
      "      was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,\n",

      "      how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.\n",
      "      She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of\n",

      "      sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\n",

      "      the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as\n",
      "      if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,\n",

      "      commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\n",
      "      enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\n",
      "      manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But\n",

      "      every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not\n",
      "      used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into\n",
      "      Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a\n",

      "      lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of\n",
      "      dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.\n",

      "      Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she\n",
      "      knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very\n",

      "      not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed\n",

      "      aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so\n",

      "      given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself\n",

      "      passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a\n",
      "      few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all\n",
      "      the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the\n",
      "      Peak.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\n",

      "\n",
      "      The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to\n",

      "      away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at\n",
      "      length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and\n",
      "      eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the\n",

      "      adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them,\n",

      "\n",
      "      The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\n",

      "      over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\n",

      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\n",
      "      Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\n",
      "      it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\n",
      "      going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\n",
      "      satin curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine\n",

      "      instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very\n",
      "      idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt\n",
      "      than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;\n",
      "      and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if\n",

      "      unfavourably answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\n",

      "      of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family\n",

      "      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper\n",

      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\n",
      "      admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually\n",
      "      ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of\n",
      "      a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was\n",
      "      instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite\n",
      "      side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.\n",
      "      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising\n",
      "      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,\n",
      "      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but\n",
      "      without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal\n",
      "      nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen\n",
      "      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty\n",
      "      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\n",
      "      all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt\n",

      "\n",

      "      the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,\n",
      "      they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited\n",
      "      for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she\n",
      "      was.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much\n",
      "      less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding\n",
      "      her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,\n",
      "      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after\n",
      "      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.\n",
      "      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving\n",
      "      increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.\n",
      "      Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the\n",
      "      whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the\n",
      "      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with\n",
      "      delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were\n",
      "      taking different positions; but from every window there were\n",
      "      beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their\n",
      "      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but\n",
      "      Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither\n",
      "      gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real\n",
      "      elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\n",

      "      in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\n",
      "      At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to\n",
      "      Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to\n",
      "      have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several\n",
      "      minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and\n",
      "      returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs.\n",
      "      Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father’s\n",
      "      lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "      There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more\n",
      "      gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\n",
      "      the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on\n",
      "      him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is\n",
      "      more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a\n",
      "      brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s\n",
      "      happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain\n",
      "      was it in his power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be\n",
      "      done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the\n",
      "      housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood\n",
      "      before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes\n",
      "      upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment\n",
      "      of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its\n",
      "      warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "      When all of the house that was open to general inspection had\n",
      "      been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\n",
      "      housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at\n",
      "      the hall-door.\n",
      "\n",
      "      As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\n",
      "      turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\n",
      "      while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\n",
      "      the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\n",
      "      which led behind it to the stables.\n",
      "\n",
      "      They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\n",
      "      his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their\n",
      "      eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\n",
      "      the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed\n",
      "      immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced\n",
      "      towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of\n",
      "      perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "      She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\n",
      "      received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\n",
      "      overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the\n",
      "      picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure\n",
      "      the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s\n",
      "      expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately\n",
      "      have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to\n",
      "      their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift\n",
      "      her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to\n",
      "      his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of\n",
      "      his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered\n",
      "      was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\n",
      "      impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the\n",
      "      few minutes in which they continued were some of the most\n",
      "      uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;\n",
      "      when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and\n",
      "      he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left\n",
      "      Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and\n",
      "      in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his\n",
      "      thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "      At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\n",
      "      few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\n",
      "      himself, and took leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\n",
      "      figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by\n",
      "      her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered\n",
      "      by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,\n",
      "      the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must\n",
      "      appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so\n",
      "      vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself\n",
      "      in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come\n",
      "      a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\n",
      "      sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\n",
      "      discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment\n",
      "      arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She\n",
      "      blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And\n",
      "      his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he\n",
      "      should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such\n",
      "      civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she\n",
      "      seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with\n",
      "      such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast\n",
      "      did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his\n",
      "      letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\n",
      "      account for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "      They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\n",
      "      and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a\n",
      "      finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it\n",
      "      was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\n",
      "      though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her\n",
      "      uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as\n",
      "      they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her\n",
      "      thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,\n",
      "      whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to\n",
      "      know what at the moment was passing in his mind—in what manner he\n",
      "      thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was\n",
      "      still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt\n",
      "      himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\n",
      "      not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\n",
      "      seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her\n",
      "      with composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "      At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence\n",
      "      of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more\n",
      "      like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\n",
      "      while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where\n",
      "      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many\n",
      "      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long\n",
      "      range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the\n",
      "      stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole\n",
      "      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant\n",
      "      smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the\n",
      "      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought\n",
      "      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to\n",
      "      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They\n",
      "      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air\n",
      "      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet\n",
      "      visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed\n",
      "      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough\n",
      "      coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its\n",
      "      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived\n",
      "      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great\n",
      "      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the\n",
      "      carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\n",
      "      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on\n",
      "      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but\n",
      "      their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to\n",
      "      indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much\n",
      "      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in\n",
      "      the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced\n",
      "      but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were\n",
      "      again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to\n",
      "      what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching\n",
      "      them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less\n",
      "      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\n",
      "      they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\n",
      "      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and\n",
      "      to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a\n",
      "      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into\n",
      "      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk\n",
      "      concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was\n",
      "      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost\n",
      "      none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she\n",
      "      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she\n",
      "      had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when\n",
      "      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise\n",
      "      of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her\n",
      "      colour changed, and she said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\n",
      "      he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to\n",
      "      her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was\n",
      "      quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\n",
      "      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people\n",
      "      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.\n",
      "      “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they\n",
      "      are? He takes them now for people of fashion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named\n",
      "      their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to\n",
      "      see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his\n",
      "      decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.\n",
      "      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he\n",
      "      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going\n",
      "      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with\n",
      "      Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but\n",
      "      triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\n",
      "      relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n",
      "      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",
      "      expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his\n",
      "      intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\n",
      "      Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as\n",
      "      often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,\n",
      "      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and\n",
      "      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually\n",
      "      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\n",
      "      Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said\n",
      "      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be\n",
      "      all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\n",
      "      continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what\n",
      "      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_—it cannot be for _my_ sake\n",
      "      that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could\n",
      "      not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should\n",
      "      still love me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\n",
      "      two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending\n",
      "      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some\n",
      "      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It\n",
      "      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the\n",
      "      morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and\n",
      "      consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by\n",
      "      her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,\n",
      "      the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been\n",
      "      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and\n",
      "      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very\n",
      "      unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\n",
      "      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,\n",
      "      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not\n",
      "      immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth\n",
      "      of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned\n",
      "      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\n",
      "      whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,”\n",
      "      he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an\n",
      "      acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were\n",
      "      instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had\n",
      "      been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by\n",
      "      his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after\n",
      "      a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will\n",
      "      you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to\n",
      "      your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”\n",
      "\n",
      "      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\n",
      "      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She\n",
      "      immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\n",
      "      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\n",
      "      without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying\n",
      "      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of\n",
      "      her.\n",
      "\n",
      "      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\n",
      "      Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\n",
      "      flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her\n",
      "      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\n",
      "      others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "      He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself\n",
      "      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time\n",
      "      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She\n",
      "      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every\n",
      "      subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,\n",
      "      and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.\n",
      "      Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas\n",
      "      were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "      On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go\n",
      "      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,\n",
      "      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy\n",
      "      handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,\n",
      "      Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\n",
      "      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\n",
      "      had expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\n",
      "      unassuming,” said her uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,”\n",
      "      replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not\n",
      "      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some\n",
      "      people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was\n",
      "      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\n",
      "      necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was\n",
      "      very trifling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as\n",
      "      Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his\n",
      "      features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he\n",
      "      was so disagreeable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\n",
      "      liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\n",
      "      she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,”\n",
      "      replied her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I\n",
      "      shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\n",
      "      another day, and warn me off his grounds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his\n",
      "      character, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I\n",
      "      really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\n",
      "      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not\n",
      "      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing\n",
      "      about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity\n",
      "      in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea\n",
      "      of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his\n",
      "      house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help\n",
      "      laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,\n",
      "      and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\n",
      "      vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them\n",
      "      to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what\n",
      "      she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were\n",

      "      surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour\n",

      "      Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was\n",
      "      exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes\n",

      "      Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\n",
      "      though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\n",
      "      appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her\n",
      "      brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her\n",
      "      manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had\n",
      "      expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as\n",

      "      the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain\n",

      "\n",
      "      In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;\n",
      "      and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his\n",
      "      were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he\n",
      "      talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\n",
      "      herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying\n",

      "      could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had\n",
      "      been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side\n",
      "      that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that\n",
      "      could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon\n",
      "      satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere\n",
      "      they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\n",
      "      recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\n",
      "      saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.\n",

      "      their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the\n",
      "      change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she\n",
      "      could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never,\n",
      "      even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his\n",
      "      dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to\n",

      "      so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,\n",
      "      above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of\n",

If you create a file called \"saveFile.txt\" in the same folder as the notebook then the following code block will work without any changes. If you create the file somewhere else you will need to update the path to the file in the `open()` function."
